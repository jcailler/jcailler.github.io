## Science Popularization

I love science promotion, and I think that sharing science with everyone is an essential part of our work. 
I participated to (and surprisingly won) a few (French) contests of science promotion: [MT180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdVQyov38sQ), which is the French edition of 3 minute thesis, and [5 minutes to convince](/assets/pdf/5_minutes_pour_convaincre.pdf). 

I also play an active role in the organization of events for the general public, such as open days or science festivals. In particular, I am involved in promoting research among students, especially [girls](https://filles-et-maths.fr/). I illustrate logic through games and puzzle-solving, using examples such as the riddles of the [Princess and the tiger](/assets/pdf/tiger.pdf) or the [Dreadbury Mansion](/assets/pdf/agatha.pdf).


## Artifact Evaluation Track Template

If you want to organize an Artifact Evaluation track for you workshop or conference and need some templates (author guide, reviewer guide, ...), feel free to reuse [this work](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AqZA5qwYZGBPhOO9AtJIJvYzne-tAYb?usp=sharing).


## Where Did We Meet?

I went to various places, and met a lot of people, that I am unfortunately not always able to remember. So, if you think we already met somewhere, you can verify your intuition here!
