        <h2 id="mccune"><a href="http://cadeinc.org/McCune-Award">Bill McCune PhD Award in Automated Reasoning 2025</a>:
          Call for Nominations</h2>
        <p>
          Automated Reasoning is the area of Computer Science dedicated to applying reasoning in the form of logic to
          computing
          systems. The Bill McCune PhD Award in Automated Reasoning distinguishes each year a PhD thesis defended the
          previous
          year, for its substantive contributions to the field of Automated Reasoning, its theory, its implementation,
          and/or its
          application on important problems. The award is named after the American computer scientist William Walker
          McCune, known
          for his contributions in the fields of Automated Reasoning, Algebra, Logic, and Formal Methods. He was the
          implementer
          of OTTER, Prover9 and Mace 4, automated tools for first-order reasoning which are known to this day for their
          accuracy
          and robustness. He was also known for his generosity towards research colleagues and as a great supporter of
          young
          researchers in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Eligibility</b> <br />

          Eligible for the award are those who successfully defended their PhD
        <ul>
          <li> at an academic institution;</li>
          <li> in the field of Automated Reasoning; and</li>
          <li> in the period from 1 January 2024 - 31 December 2024.</li>
        </ul>

        The PhD students supervised or co-supervised by the Expert Committee members are not eligible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Nomination</b> <br />

          Candidates for the award must be nominated by their supervisor(s) and one additional independent researcher
          who
          reviewed/examined the thesis. Nominations are to be submitted <a href="mailto:c.fuhs@bbk.ac.uk">via email</a>,
          by <b>February 24, 2024</b> (Anywhere on Earth).
        </p>
        <p>
          The nomination must consist of one compressed file (.zip) containing:

        <ul>
          <li> a letter from the supervisor(s) describing why the thesis should be considered for the award and the
            relationship of the contributions to CADE/IJCAR;</li>
          <li> a report from the nominating additional independent researcher who reviewed/examined the thesis;</li>
          <li> the thesis itself;</li>
          <li> a copy of the PhD diploma; and</li>
          <li> a copy of relevant papers by the nominee, if any, containing results published in the thesis.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Procedure</b> <br />

          The thesis will be evaluated with respect to its quality, originality and (potential) impact to the field of
          Automated Reasoning.

        <ul>
          <li> The nominations will be evaluated and compared by an international Expert Committee (see below).</li>
          <li> The procedure to be followed is analogous to the review phase of a conference. The justification by the
            supervisor and the nominating additional independent researcher report will play an important role in the
            evaluation.</li>
          <li> The final decision is made by the Expert Committee at least one month before CADE/IJCAR is being held.
          </li>
          <li> The award consists of a certificate announcing the winner to have received the Bill McCune PhD Award in
            Automated
            Reasoning. The award will be announced at the respective year's CADE/IJCAR. The nominators of the winner

          <b>Expert Committee</b> <br />

          The Expert Committee, consisting of leading researchers in Automating Reasoning, is formed by the board of
          CADE Trustees
          with the aim to reflect the broad diversity in the area of Automated Reasoning. It is announced with the call
          for
          nominations, and thus formed before this call. The decision on the award is taken by the Expert Committee. The
          Expert
          Committee can seek additional expertise, even after the submission deadline for nominations. Expert Committee
          members
          cannot nominate a PhD student. Expert Committee members cannot contribute an independent report seconding a
          nomination.

          The scope of SAT 2025 includes all aspects of the theory and applications of propositional satisfiability
          broadly
          construed.
          This includes paradigms such as Boolean optimization using, e.g., MaxSAT and pseudo-Boolean (PB) solving,
          quantified
          Boolean formulas (QBF), satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), model counting, constraint programming (CP),
          and
          integer
          linear programming (ILP) for problems with clear connections to Boolean-level reasoning. This year the 31st
          International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP) will be co-located with
          SAT
          and
          will
          have deadlines and reviewing process synchronized with SAT 2025.

        <h4>Call for Workshop Proposals</h4>

        <p>
          We invite proposals for workshops to be held immediately before the main conferences in Glasgow, UK.
          Workshops offer an
          opportunity for in-depth discussions, hands-on experiences, and focused exploration of specific areas
          connected to
          constraint programming, SAT solving, and related topics.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given the co-location of the CP and SAT conferences, we especially encourage proposals for workshops of
          interest to both
          communities. Some example topics from recent years are pragmatics of constraint reasoning, constraint
          modelling and
          SAT/SMT encodings, counting and sampling, logic-based methods in ML, CP-SAT solving, proof complexity,
          certifying
          algorithms, and logic and search. Proposals of interest to a single community, either on previously covered
          topics or
          new topics, are also welcome.
        </p>

        <p>
          While you are free to have a traditional workshop with submitted papers, we also encourage new ideas and
          formats that
          could foster more interaction from your audience. We encourage in particular short papers and position
          papers, a
          lightweight review process, and poster sessions.

          More and more mathematical information is digitally processed, generated,
          communicated, stored, and curated. CICM brings together the many separate
          communities that have developed theoretical and practical solutions for
          mathematical applications such as computation, deduction, knowledge management,
          and user interfaces. It offers a venue for discussing problems and solutions in
          each of these areas and their integration. Besides the CICM main program
          soliciting formal CICM submissions there will be associated workshops with
          separate submission options.

        <h4>20th International Symposium on Logical and Semantic Frameworks, with Applications</h4>

        <p>
          LFSA 2025 is a satellite event of CICM 2025. LSFA is an International Symposium on Logical and Semantic
          Frameworks with Applications launched in 2006. Logical and
          semantic frameworks are formal languages that represent logics and languages, as well as computational, AI and
          deductive
          systems. These frameworks provide mathematical foundations for the formal specification of systems and
          programming
          languages, supporting tool development and reasoning.
        </p>

        <p>
          The LSFA series is a platform that fosters collaboration, bringing together theoreticians and practitioners.
          LSFA aims
          to promote techniques and results from the theoretical side, ranging from well-established ones such as lambda
          calculus
          and type theory to state-of-the-art ones such as machine learning, and provide feedback on integrating,
          implementing and
          using such methods and results from the practical side.

          Conference on Artificial Intelligence, which will take place in the historic city of Bologna from October 25
          to 30, 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          We welcome submissions on all aspects of AI. Submissions will be subject to double-blind peer review by the

          scholarship, and quality of presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conference is planned as an in-person event. Each accepted paper will get assigned either an oral

          engineering disciplines. Climate modeling, weather prediction, drug
          discovery, the design of buildings, vehicles, and aircraft,
          simulations of astrophysical phenomena, and prediction of seismic
          activity are some of the many applications. Verification of such
          software presents numerous challenges, e.g.: the programs are large,
          complex, and utilize multiple CPU and GPU concurrency interfaces;
          precise reasoning about real or floating-point operations is often
          required; there is often no oracle; and correctness may require
          reasoning about deep mathematical concepts such as convergence and
          stability. This workshop will focus on verification techniques that
          address these challenges, including approaches based on deductive
          reasoning, model checking, symbolic execution, abstract
          interpretation, and static analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
          The workshop will take place as part of ETAPS 2025, on Sunday, May 4,
          2025, at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. We aim to bring
          together researchers from both the scientific computing and the
          software verification communities. Through invited talks and
          presentations of peer-reviewed papers, participants will learn about
          the correctness challenges developers face, as well as a variety of
          verification approaches for tackling those challenges.

          We are
          interested in all aspects of the verification problem for scientific
          software, including, but not limited to:

            Methods
            for Blockchains</a>, call for papers</h3>
        <div class="details">May 04, 2025, Hamilton, ON, Canada (Co-located with <a

        <p>
          Blockchain is a novel technology to store data in a decentralized way. Although the technology was
          originally
          invented
          to enable cryptocurrencies, it quickly found applications in several other domains.
        </p>

        <p>
          Blockchains may also provide support for Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are scripts of an ad-hoc
          programming
          language
          that are stored on the blockchain and that run on the network. They can interact with the ledger’s data and
          update its
          state. These scripts can express the logic of possibly complex contracts between users of the blockchain.
          Thus, Smart
          Contracts can facilitate the economic activities of blockchain participants.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since blockchains are often used to store financial transactions, bugs may result in huge economic losses
          and
          thus it is
          now of utmost importance to have strong guarantees of the behaviour of blockchain software. These guarantees
          can be
          brought by using Formal Methods. Indeed, Blockchain software encompasses many topics of computer science
          where
          using
          Formal Methods techniques and tools is relevant: consensus algorithms to ensure the liveness and the
          security
          of the
          data on the chain, programming languages specifically designed to write smart contracts, cryptographic
          protocols, such
          as zero-knowledge proofs, used to ensure privacy, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          Topics of interest include (but are not restricted to):
        <ul>
          <li>Formal models of blockchain applications or concepts</li>
          <li>Formal methods for consensus protocols</li>
          <li>Formal methods for blockchain-specific cryptographic primitives or protocols</li>
          <li>Formal languages for Smart Contracts</li>

          The aim of this workshop is to bring together experts in proof theory with specialists in formal mathematics
          and
          automated theorem proving, in order to facilitate an interdisciplinary exchange of ideas on the mutual
          benefit that
          these areas can have on one another.

          On the one hand, the workshop will focus on how methods from proof theory, such as advanced techniques aimed
          at
          extracting computational content from large scale nonconstructive proofs in mainstream mathematics, can be
          implemented
          and partially automated within theorem provers. In the other direction, we will explore whether the rich
          variety of
          logical systems developed by proof theorists could benefit the world of formal mathematics by both
          simplifying and
          streamlining the formalisation process.
        </p>

        <p>
          We welcome 30 minute contributed talks on any topic broadly within the scope of the workshop. We are
          particularly
          interested in work that explores the following themes and their intersection:
        <ul>
          <li>Proof theory and its applications, particularly the extraction of programs from proofs.</li>
          <li>Logical systems for reasoning about mathematics or the sciences.</li>
          <li>Proof assistants (e.g. Agda, Coq, Isabelle, Lean).</li>
          <li>Applications of AI and machine learning to formal mathematics.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Presentations from research students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged. To propose a

        <div class="details">June 23 - July 5, 2025, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, USA</div>
        <p>
          For 23 years, the Oregon Programming Languages Summer School has been devoted to teaching the principles of
          programming
          languages to students and professionals. Although the topics vary from year to year, the unifying theme is
          the
          importance of fundamental theory to the design and implementation of programming languages, the development
          of program
          verification tools, and the application of advanced programming languages to practice. The summer school
          attracts
          participants from around the world, and is often able to subsidize the participation of qualified attendees
          with limited
          resources. More than a thousand participants have attended OPLSS since its inception in 2002. The summer
          school is
          sponsored by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a>, and by generous grants from
          numerous companies over the years.
        </p>

        <p>
          The program takes place over two weeks, with ample time for group and private study, and to take advantage
          of the many
          recreational opportunities around Eugene. The sessions are non-overlapping, so participants will have the
          opportunity to attend all lectures. Each lecture is 80
          minutes, including time for questions.

            Solvers</a></h3>
        <div class="details">February 26, 2025, Philadelphia, PA, USA</div>
        <p>
          Machine learning (ML) and logical reasoning have been the two foundational pillars of AI since its inception,
          yet it is
          only in the past decade that interactions between these fields have become increasingly prominent. Notably, ML
          has had a
          dramatic impact on SAT and SMT solvers, as demonstrated by the award-winning SATzilla, MapleSAT, and Z3alpha
          solvers.
          Our tutorial aims to inspire new interdisciplinary research by bridging the gap between ML and logical
          reasoning
          research communities. We will introduce the broader AI community to ML techniques that have been used in the
          context of
          logical reasoning solvers, with a sharp focus on approaches that are successful and promising. We will also
          host
          a panel
          discussion on how LLMs may shape this area going forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rather than pure end-to-end learning, successful ML approaches tend to be tightly integrated with symbolic
          solvers. The
          central thesis of our tutorial, supported by numerous successful cases, is that ML excels best when it is used
          to
          sequence, select, initialize, and configure proof/rewrite rules that solvers implement. One prominent example
          that we
          will highlight is the use of ML for learning branching heuristics, both online for particular instances using
          reinforcement learning (RL) and offline training a neural network policy across representative instances from
          a
          particular application.
        </p>

        <p>
          There will be theory, hands-on lab, and panel discussion on the use of ML for solvers.

        <p>
          VerifyThis is a series of program verification competitions, which has taken place annually since 2011 (with
          the
          exception of 2020). Previous competitions in the series have been held at FoVeOOS 2011, FM 2012, Dagstuhl
          (April 2014),
          and ETAPS 2015-2024. The challenge problems and solutions of previous competitions are available in the <a
            href="https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/verifythis/Archive.html">archive</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The aims of the competition are:
        <ul>
          <li>to bring together those interested in formal verification, and to provide an engaging, hands-on, and fun
            opportunity for
            discussion.</li>
          <li>to evaluate the usability of program verification techniques and tools.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          The competition will offer a number of challenges presented in natural language and pseudo code.
          Participants
          have to formalize the requirements, implement a solution, and formally verify the implementation for
          adherence
          to the
          specification.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are no restrictions on the programming language and verification technology used. The correctness
          properties posed
          in problems will have the input-output behavior of programs in focus. Solutions will be judged for
          correctness,
          completeness, and elegance.
        </p>

        <p>
          To be able to offer a broad and diverse set of verification challenges, we are collecting submissions of
          ideas
          for
          verification challenges and problems. We welcome both problems of academic interest as well as challenges
          based on
          themes that are relevant in industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          The competition proceeds in three rounds. In each round, participants are given 60 - 120 minutes to
          implement
          and prove
          specified properties of a given algorithm and/or data structure. They are free to use any verification tools
          they
          choose. Challenges are typically concerned with proving functional properties of the code in question (at
          least some
          part of a challenge involves expressing and proving properties specific to the algorithm/data structure in
          question). It
          is common for problems to have multiple parts, e.g. to prove some basic properties first, perhaps for a
          simplified case,
          and to progress to more-advanced goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are currently looking for problem submissions! If you have recently encountered an interesting challenge
          in
          your work
          where formal techniques could be applied, please don't hesitate to submit it. Typical challenges have clear
          input-output
          specifications and often incorporate one or more of the following: heap allocation, concurrency, arithmetic
          reasoning. A
          challenge usually describes a problem using natural language together with some pseudocode, and then
          provides
          a list of
          properties or "verification tasks" of varied levels of difficulty. Contributors are encouraged to look at
          the
          Archive of
          previous problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          An award will be given for any submission used in the competition. To avoid spoiling the competition for
          others, we ask
          that you keep the subject of your submission private. However, note that problem authors are allowed to
          participate in
          the competition!
        </p>

        <p>
          A submission should consist of:
        <ul>
          <li>A brief yet precise problem description, specifically identifying verification sub-tasks.</li>
          <li>A solution to the challenge is strongly encouraged, otherwise please provide a sketch of correctness.
          </li>
          <li>The description document can use any reasonable format, including plain text or PDF.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 id="PhDLondon">PhD Studentship at UCL Computer Science, UK</h3>

        <p>
          We invite applications for a four-year PhD studentship on the Leverhulme-funded project "ECUMENICAL:
          Proof-theoretic
          semantics for non-classical and modal logics," led by Dr. Elaine Pimentel, Prof. David Pym, and Prof. Luiz
          Carlos
          Pereira at UCL Computer Science, UK.
        </p>

        <p>
          This interdisciplinary studentship, situated at the intersection of informatics, mathematics, and
          philosophy,
          is open to
          UK (home) students. The research will focus on developing proof-theoretic semantics for non-classical and
          modal logics,
          constructing the necessary abstract mathematical meta-theory, and investigating the implications of
          inferentialist
          semantics for systems verification. The project will build on recent advancements at UCL, including
          connections between
          the proof-theoretic foundations of logic programming and base-extension semantics, with potential
          exploration
          of
          applications to simulation modelling and its inferentialist interpretation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The successful candidate will work closely with Dr. Elaine Pimentel (Computer Science), Prof. David Pym
          (Computer
          Science and Philosophy), and Prof. Luiz Carlos Pereira (Philosophy, UERJ Brazil). The student will be based
          within the
          Programming Principles, Logic, and Verification group at UCL Computer Science.
