### [Goéland](https://github.com/GoelandProver/Goeland)



Goéland is an automated theorem prover for first-order logic with equality. It relies on a
concurrent proof-search procedure based on the method of free-variable analytics tableaux that
allows it to perform a fair branch exploration. The prover is also able to deal with axiomatisable
theories thanks to a module of deduction modulo theory, to deal with polymorphic types,
and to produce machine-checkable proofs in Coq, Lambdapi and Lisa.

### [SC-TPTP Utilities](https://github.com/SC-TPTP/sc-tptp)

Work done in collaboration with [Simon Guilloud](https://simonguilloud.ch/).

SC-TPTP Utilities is a library of tools able to deal with the SC-TPTP format. It includes softwares able to handle, import, export and transform proofs in SC-TPTP format, to add intermediate proof steps, and to export them into Coq.
