      <h3 id="marijn">Nominee statement of Marijn Heule</h3>

      <p>
        CADE and IJCAR, along with SAT, are my favorite conferences due to their stimulation of exciting and important
        research. Since 2012, I have had the pleasure of participating in most CADE and IJCAR conferences and serving on
        several of their program committees, including co-chairing IJCAR'24. Additionally, I was honored to serve as a
        trustee
        from 2017 to 2022.
      </p>

      <p>

        My research focuses on two significant challenges in automated deduction: validating the correctness of complex
        techniques developed by the community and leveraging the power of large computer clusters. Although my work
        primarily
        targets SAT and QBF solving, these challenges are also crucial for first-order logic and beyond. I am
        particularly
        interested in promoting the application of successful techniques from propositional logic to richer logics.
      </p>

      <p>

        The community has developed powerful tools such as CaDiCaL, Vampire, and Z3, which have also found success in
        industry. I support encouraging paper submissions that demonstrate the impact of these tools on solving relevant
        problems, as such papers can have a broad impact. Furthermore, I advocate for the requirement that experimental
        evaluations be reproducible by reviewers and the wider community.
      </p>

      <p>

        I strongly believe that all future publications in automated reasoning, including CADE/IJCAR proceedings and JAR
        articles, should be Open Access. This approach enhances accessibility and can expand the community. Although
        there are
        concerns about the financial impact on authors and participants, I believe we can address these through
        sponsorships
        and agreements with funding agencies. I favor using LIPIcs for conference proceedings over LNCS, due to ongoing
        issues
        with Springer, including typesetting. A recent community survey showed overwhelming support for LIPIcs, and as a
        trustee, I will push to implement this change.
      </p>

      <p>

        The current structure of alternating yearly between CADE and IJCAR and joining FLOC every four years strikes the
        right
        balance between focusing on our community and maintaining visibility with related communities. I support
        coordinating
        the locations of CADE/IJCAR/FLOC conferences to improve geographic distribution. Despite most CADE attendees
        being
        from Europe, I am committed to encouraging participation from North American researchers. Thus, it is important
        to
        continue organizing CADE/IJCAR regularly in the US or Canada.
      </p>



      <h3 id="claudia">Nominee statement of Cl&aacute;udia Nalon</h3>

      <p>
        I am honoured and excited to be nominated once again to serve on the CADE's Board of Trustees. I have actively
        participated in both CADE and IJCAR for many years. I contributed both research and tool papers to either
        conference,
        served as a PC member several times, and helped with the organisation of the first edition of CADE in South
        America. I
        also have experience as a PC member, chair, SC member and organiser for other conferences in our field.
      </p>

      <p>
        My research is focused on both the theoretical foundations and practical aspects related to the implementation
        of
        proof methods for non-classical logics and their combinations. CADE and IJCAR are (and should remain) welcoming
        venues
        for research encompassing a broad range of logics and techniques. I feel at home here and I am deeply committed
        to
        this community. As an enthusiastic implementer, I advocate for the increase of submission numbers of system and
        tool
        papers, and for introducing demo sessions for tools at the conference. This is not only important in my field,
        but
        more generally, as it encourages and celebrates the hard work of producing these tools.
      </p>

      <p>

        I very strongly believe that a better geographical distribution of conference sites for CADE would be beneficial
        to
        our community. It will help to stimulate research and disseminate knowledge about automated reasoning and also
        attract
        talented individuals from regions that are not well represented in our field at present. We need to be sensitive
        to
        the fact that in those areas funding is often not available, and both researchers and students may have
        difficulties
        with meeting travel expenses and registration fees. I therefore support continuing the Bledsoe Award, to support

        Costs are important. I support maintaining open access to the CADE proceedings to ensure the broad dissemination
        of
        our research. Open access is not for free, though, and we need to be mindful of what serves our community best
        and
        carefully evaluate cost-effective options. The consultation made by the current Board of Trustees already gives
        us a
        direction. However, it is also crucial to consider the impact of any changes to our sister conferences, TABLEAUX
        and
        FroCoS, which we join every two years to form IJCAR. I support therefore that we continue with discussions with
        their
        steering committees, as decided in our recent meeting in Nancy, before making any decision.
      </p>

      <p>

        Thank you for considering my nomination. I am looking forward to the opportunity to continue contributing to our
        community.

      <h3 id="martin">Nominee statement of Martin Suda</h3>

      <p>
        I am honored to be nominated for the CADE Board of Trustees. CADE-22 (Montreal, 2009) was my very first serious
        conference and, with one exception, I took part at CADE and IJCAR ever since. I have served on the program
        committee
        of these conferences for the last six years. Since 2023, I am also a member of the steering committee of CADE's
        sibling FroCoS.
      </p>

      <p>

        My current primary research interest is automated theorem proving and how it can be boosted through the
        techniques of
        machine learning. In the past, I also worked on temporal reasoning, SAT/QBF, and model finding. I am one of the
        main
        developers of the award-winning automatic theorem prover Vampire.
      </p>

      <p>

        I am generally happy with the scope of CADE, catering for a wide range of topics, for both theoretical papers
        and
        those with focus on implementation. I like the regular merging with neighboring conferences on even years, which
        ensures we keep close contact with related fields. I also more than agree with the continuous support of young
        researchers, be it in the form of the Woody Bledsoe Student Travel Award, the Bill McCune PhD award, or in
        organizing
        the SAT/SMT/AR summer school.
      </p>

      <p>

        The transition to the open access publication model was a step in the right direction. However, I believe that
        lower
        publication fees and less copy editing from the side of the publisher would improve our situation further. I
        understand that some funding agencies or career promotion committees may regard LNCS as prestigious, while they
        have
        not heard of LIPIcs yet, but that is a separate battle that we should fight elsewhere. For instance, by making
        sure
        CADE maintains or even improves on its current CORE ranking.

          The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission-critical and safety-critical systems at NASA and in
          the
          aerospace industry requires advanced technologies to address their specification, design, verification,
          validation, and
          certification. The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is a forum to foster collaboration between theoreticians and
          practitioners from NASA, other government agencies, academia, and industry, with the goal of identifying
          challenges and
          providing solutions towards achieving assurance for such critical systems. The focus of this symposium is on
          formal
          techniques for software and system assurance for applications in space, aviation, robotics, and other
          NASA-relevant
          critical systems.

            Proving and Machine Learning in the age of LLMs: SoA and Future Perspectives</a></h3>
        <div class="details">April 7-8, 2025, Edinburgh, UK</div>
        <p>
          Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be very successful in programming and translation talks, and creates
          new
          opportunities combining AI with proofs. Recently, various claims have been made that large language models
          (LLMs) will
          revolutionise these areas. However, many questions about the details of the applications of LLMs and their
          impact on
          theorem proving and mathematics remain open. At the workshop, we want to bring together researchers from a
          wide range of
          communities: mathematics, automated and interactive theorem proving, machine learning, natural language
          processing, and
          formal methods, in order to discuss the state-of the-art and future directions for this new area of research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of topics that we intend to discuss include, but are not limited to:
        <ul>
          <li>ML/LLM for Advancing Proof Techniques, e.g., tailoring LLMs to theorem-proving datasets and benchmarks,
            combining
            neural networks and symbolic reasoning for robust theorem proving, enabling LLMs to learn proof techniques
            from
            minimal data or prior examples.</li>
          <li>Applications of ML/LLM in Theorem Proving, e.g., designing co-pilot systems for theorem provers like Coq,
            Lean, or
            Isabelle, auto-formalising mathematical concepts and proofs from textbooks or research papers, human-machine
            collaboration workflows in proof construction.</li>
          <li>Challenges and Limitations of ML/LLM in Theorem Proving, e.g. addressing hallucinations and errors in
            proofs
            generated by LLMs, handling large and complex proof spaces with LLM-guided tools, mitigating biases
            introduced
            during LLM training on specific mathematical domains.</li>
          <li>Benchmarks and Evaluation for ML/LLM in Theorem Proving, e.g., creating datasets specifically for
            evaluating
            LLM-based theorem proving systems, assessing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM-generated
            proofs,
            defining success metrics for proof assistance beyond correctness, such as creativity and accessibility.</li>
          <li>Interdisciplinary Impact of ML/LLM, e.g., leveraging LLMs to teach formal methods, logic, and theorem
            proving to
            students, using LLMs to explore conjectures and new areas of mathematical research, applications in formal
            verification for software, hardware, and systems engineering, including industrial applications.</li>
          <li>Future Directions for ML/LLM in Theorem Proving: e.g., the implications of relying on AI systems for
            critical
            mathematical proofs, setting open standards for the integration of LLMs in the theorem-proving workflows,
            speculating on the evolution of LLMs and their roles in formal reasoning.</li>
          <li>Cross-Domain Connections: e.g., developing user-friendly natural language interfaces for proof assistants,
            adapting LLM capabilities from general domains to formal logic and proofs.</li>
        </ul>

          practice of software development and computing systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose of this special issue of JLAMP is to collect recent, original,
          and high-quality contributions on unification theory and its applications,
          as well as closely related topics. Unification is concerned with the problem
          of making two given terms equal, either syntactically or modulo an equational
          theory. It is a fundamental process used in various areas of computer science,
          including automated reasoning, term rewriting, logic programming, natural
          language processing, program analysis, knowledge representation, types, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          The International Workshop on Unification (UNIF) is the main international
          event on unification. This special issue is related to the research presented
          in the last four editions of the workshop, i.e., from UNIF 2021 to UNIF 2024.
          Nevertheless, submissions of high quality works on unification that were not
          presented at UNIF are also welcome. Thus, participants of UNIF, as well as
          other authors, are invited to submit contributions.
        </p>

        <p>Following the tradition of UNIF, this special issue addresses the topic of unification in a broad sense. A
          non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Syntactic and equational unification algorithms</li>
          <li>Matching and constraint solving</li>
          <li>Higher-order unification</li>
          <li>Unification in modal, temporal, and description logics</li>
          <li>Admissibility of inference rules</li>
          <li>Narrowing</li>
          <li>Disunification</li>
          <li>Anti-unification</li>
          <li>Complexity issues</li>
          <li>Combination methods</li>
          <li>Implementation techniques</li>
          <li>Applications</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>

          The assistant professor will be working at the Department of Computer
          Science, where research into the foundations of computer science is

          Nordstrom leads the <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group">research group Mathematical Insights into
            Algorithms for Optimization</a>, which is also
          active at the University of Copenhagen. The research has a unique
          profile in that it spans a wide range of questions from the theoretical,
          mathematical foundations of efficient computation all the way to
          state-of-the-art practical algorithms for real-world problems. This

        <p>
          This position focuses on algorithms for foundational problems within
          logic, automated reasoning, and combinatorial optimization. This
          includes design and implementation of algorithms for computational
          problems within Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving, constraint
          programming, mixed integer linear programming, and/or satisfiability
          modulo theories (SMT) solving. In addition to algorithm construction,
          another topic of interest is to develop a scientific understanding of
          the practical performance of automated reasoning algorithms, and to
          investigate relations between empirical observations and theoretical
          results in algorithm analysis and computational complexity theory. Yet
          another related area concerns methods of ensuring that algorithms
          compute provably correct results, which can be used to develop
          trustworthy solvers for automated reasoning and combinatorial optimization.
