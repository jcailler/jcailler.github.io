      <h2 id="memories-cade-body">Memories of CADE, Inspired by a visit to Bob Boyer</h2>
      <div class="details">
        <a href="https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/geoff/">Geoff Sutcliffe</a>
      </div>

      <p>
        The first CADE I attended was CADE-10 in 1990, in Kaiserslautern, Germany. I was very very green in the ATP
        world, and
        completely in awe of the founders who were there: Alan Bundy, Wolfgang Bibel, Peter Andrews, Woody Bledsoe, and
        more.
        Bob Boyer and J Moore gave the keynote, and Woody gave the banquet talk. That’s when I really noticed Bob. The
        banquet
        was in a church with a high vaulted ceiling, and thus had awful acoustics. Woody was using one of those old
        projectors
        with plastic slides and a 6’x6’ screen. Woody never had a loud voice, and it was very hard to follow his talk. I
        was
        seated at the second to back table, and people were starting to chatter. In one of those coincidental moments
        when
        everyone stops talking, a loud voice called out from the table behind me: “Waiter, more red wine at this
        table!”. I
        turned around … it was Bob Boyer. I knew two things immediately: (i) Bob Boyer was my kind of guy, (ii) I was
        going to
        attend many more CADE conferences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early in February 2025 I went to Austin to visit Bob, to collect one of Larry Wos’ bowling balls, which Bob had
        won from
        Larry in a bet (it’s a whole other story). I had arranged with the CADE trustees that the ball was to become the
        prize
        for the Best Student Paper at CADE/IJCAR. Sadly Bob was ill when I visited, so Grant Passmore took me to visit
        Bob in
        the recuperation hospital. What a pleasure chatting with Bob, with his sharp mind and sharp wit. Warren Hunt
        dropped in
        too, so it was a grand time. The visit reminded me of the incident at CADE-10, so I told Bob the story! It was
        just one
        of many memorable moments at CADE/IJCAR conferences, prompting me to write down some of those memories. Thanks
        Bob for
        starting me off on this personal and intermittent history of “Memories of CADE”.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>CADE-10, Kaiserslautern, Germany, 1990</i>: I already told that story!</li>
        <li><i>CADE-11, Saratoga Springs, USA, 1992</i>. This was the first CADE where I had a paper accepted, and I
          gave the talk. I was
          so very nervous that I garbled the presentation off in about 15 minutes, and presumably confused the audience.
          The
          session chair was quite kind, and let me slink off in shame. I’ve gotten better, or at least more confident,
          since then!</li>
        <li><i>CADE-12, Nancy, France, 1994</i>. This CADE was memorable for the conception of CASC, but that story was
          told at IJCAR 2024,
          Nancy, France, 2024. The invited talk at CADE-12 by John Slaney was memorable. After John was introduced he
          went to the
          lectern and said (roughly): “I am a philosopher, and like a true philosopher I will now read my paper”. John
          then opened
          the LNCS volume and started reading his paper. When his time was up he told the audience they could: “read the
          rest in
          the proceedings”. That was just too cool for me.</li>
        <li><i>CADE-14, Townsville, Australia, 1997</i>. By this time I was well established at James Cook University,
          and could take on
          running CADE. It was also the second CASC. For the excursion I booked a large catamaran to take us out to the
          Great
          Barrier Reef. We all had fun, even David McAllester who got “attacked” by a pelican when we surfaced from
          SCUBA diving.
          One of the invited speakers was Prof. Wu Wen-Tsun - a senior academic. The waves picked up on the way back in,
          and one
          of the students (from the TUM group) on the upper level got seasick. Prof Wu was on the lower level below her.
          Aaaaargh.</li>
        <li><i>CADE-16, Trento, Italy, 1999</i>. That was another year where Bob Boyer shined - he and J Moore jointly
          received the
          Herbrand award. I recall Chris Suttner’s prediction that we would also jointly get the award some time, if we
          kept
          working on the TPTP. Now that cannot come true, which makes me sad.</li>
        <li><i>CADE-17, Pittsburgh, USA, 2000</i>. That was the year when I found out that Frank Pfenning is (or at
          least was) very fit -
          after lunch one day I was sitting outside and watched Frank come storming past, out for a quick run. His
          prowess at
          squash was also established that year. CADE-17 was the start of “CADE adventure excursions”, when David
          McAllester
          arranged for us to go white water kayaking/rafting. David managed to get stuck on a rock, and Stephan Schulz
          (an
          accomplished kayaker) had to rescue him. Stephan told me: “I rescued Dave McAllester, who was stranded on a
          rock, but he
          still refused to review a paper for me.“</li>
        <li><i>IJCAR-2001, Siena, Italy, 2001</i>. That year was famous for John Slaney’s musical Otter. He had taken
          the given clauses
          from various proof runs by Otter, and converted their weights into a sequence of notes on a diatonic scale.
          His joy at
          the difference between the songs produced by proofs in Boolean algebra vs. those in set theory was a complete
          delight!</li>
        <li><i>IJCAR-2004, Cork, Ireland, 2004</i>. The only CADE where attendees shared cooties, by all kissing the
          Blarney Stone.</li>
        <li><i>CADE-20, Tallinn, Estonia, 2005</i>. The highlight for me was Niklas Sörensson’s invited talk at the
          workshop on Empirically
          Successful Classical Automated Reasoning (ESCAR), in which he presented the principles and implementation
          details of
          MiniSat. When someone asked how he made it so fast he explained that in some heavily used data structure there
          was a
          pointer to a pointer to the data, and by converting the two levels of indirection to just one MiniSat had
          become
          significantly faster. Small detail, large impact!</li>
        <li><i>IJCAR 2008, Sydney, Australia, 2008</i>. ATP down under again! The excursion was to the Blue Mountains,
          and most people went
          down to the bottom of the gorge. Afterwards at the reception someone noticed that Adam Pease was not with us.
          Panic
          ensued, with concern that he might be injured in the gorge, where he was likely to freeze to death overnight.
          Many
          frantic phone calls later Adam was located - he had come up from the gorge just after the buses left, managed
          to get a
          ride with the park ranger to the nearest train station, and took a train back to join us. It was almost an
          LPAR moment.</li>
        <li><i>IJCAR 2012, Manchester, United Kingdom, 2012</i>. A tremendous conference arranged by Andrei Voronkov
          with famous people in
          attendance, including John Alan Robinson, Peter Andrews, and Martin Davis. At the banquet I got those three
          illuminati
          to sign a T-shirt, and then ran a silent auction for it. Chris Benzmüller won, and has the T-shirt up in his
          office -
          it’s a part of ATP history!</li>
        <li><i>CADE-26, Gothenburg, Sweden, 2017</i>. A link in Bob Boyer’s chain of influence was revealed in Grant
          Passmore’s invited
          talk on the foundations of Grant’s company, Imandra. Bob was Grant’s undergraduate honour’s thesis advisor.
        </li>
        <li><i>CADE-27, Natal, Brasil, August 2019</i>. At LPAR in Fiji I had bugged Elaine Pimental about hosting CADE
          in Natal. She did,
          and it was great … the outing on beach buggies, eating huge tomahawk steaks, caipirinhas on the beach. Thanks
          Elaine!</li>
        <li><i>CADE-29, Rome, Italy, 2023</i>. The highlight (for me) was Moshe Vardi’s most quotable quote during his
          invited talk: “Life
          is NP-hard, but somehow we muddle through”.</li>

        Looking back on what I have written, it feels horribly self-centred. Maybe so, and I hope it brings back some
        personal
        memories for others — write them down … I’ll read them!

      This is to let you know that Peter Andrews (November 1, 1937 - April
      21, 2025), an early leader in the theory and applications of
      higher-order logic and the 2003 recipient of the Herbrand Award,
      passed away recently at the age of 87. A memorial is expected in the near future.

      <p>We invite proposals for sites around the world to host the International Conference on Automated Deduction
        (CADE) to
        be held in summer 2027. CADE typically merges into IJCAR (the International Joint Conference on Automated
        Reasoning)
        in even years, and meets as an independent conference in odd years. For odd years, both proposals to host CADE
        alone
        or CADE co-located with other conferences are welcome.
      </p>

      <p><b>The deadline for proposals is July 27 2025.</b></p>

      <p>

          The ACL2 Workshop series is the major technical forum for users of the ACL2 theorem proving system to present
          research
          related to the ACL2 theorem prover and its applications. ACL2 is an industrial-strength automated reasoning
          system,

        <h4>Logic Mentoring Workshop</h4>
        <p>
          Attending a conference such as LICS can be a transformative experience. It exposes participants to
          cutting-edge research
          and can open up new research avenues and collaboration opportunities. The Logic Mentoring Workshop introduces
          young
          researchers to the technical and practical aspects of a career in logic research. It is targeted at students,
          from
          senior undergraduates to doctoral students, and will include tutorials and plenary talks as well as a panel
          discussion,
          where experienced researchers from the field answer career-related questions from the audience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Students (undergrad, master's, and PhD alike) can apply to have their costs (some or all) covered by our
          sponsors, the
          National Science Foundation (NSF) and Jane Street. Application deadline is <b>May 10, 2025</b> (applications
          are accepted after that date if funds allow). Please apply by filling out <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1won7RTFgMbMtzhNiAARP5BzXTLPJKVcAj9zyIlmqVL8">this form</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Is this the first conference you will attend in person? We have all been there. You might not feel comfortable
          if you
          don't know anyone. We will have a Buddy Program, where we will help you to get in touch with another mentoring
          workshop
          attendee. Every newcomer will be assigned either a more experienced peer or another newcomer, so you are not
          alone. For
          those who are not attending a conference for the first time, being a buddy is a way for you to help the
          community to
          grow and introduce less experienced students to the field.

        <p>
          Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and vibrant field of research within
          Artificial
          Intelligence. KR builds on the fundamental thesis that knowledge can often be represented in an explicit
          declarative
          form, suitable for processing by dedicated symbolic reasoning engines. This enables the exploitation of
          knowledge that
          would otherwise be implicit through semantically grounded inference mechanisms. KR has contributed to the
          theory and
          practice of various areas of AI, including agents, automated planning, robotics, and natural language
          processing, and to
          fields beyond AI, including
          data management, semantic web, verification, software engineering, computational biology, and cybersecurity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely, in-depth presentation of progress in the theory and
          practice
          of the representation and computational management of knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          KR 2025 will include three special thematic tracks, a Recently Published Research Track, tutorials, workshops,
          and a
          Doctoral Consortium. Details about all these events and the corresponding calls can be found on the website.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the main track, we solicit papers presenting novel results on the principles of KR, which clearly
          contribute to
          the
          formal foundations of the field or show the applicability of KR techniques to implemented or implementable
          systems. We
          welcome papers from other areas that demonstrate clear use of, or contributions to, the principles or practice
          of KR.
          We
          also encourage "reports from the field" of applications, experiments, developments, and tests.

        <h4>KR in the Wild Track</h4>
        <p>
          As a complement to the traditional KR Main track focusing more on theoretical advances in KR, the KR in the
          Wild
          track
          aims to showcase successful deployments of KR formalisms in all types of application domains as well as recent
          developments in the state-of-the-art in automated reasoning systems which form the basis for successful
          deployment
          of
          declarative problem solving in an ever-increasing number of practical settings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Towards these goals, the KR in the Wild Track welcomes contributions from areas that are sometimes considered
          as not
          core KR research. This includes (but is not restricted to) state-of-the-art reasoning systems and solvers
          developed
          in
          the various vibrant declarative programming communities as well as insightful applications of such systems. As
          further
          goals, the track aims to foster interactions between practical and theoretical advances, and to encourage the
          discussion
          of new ideas, research experiences, emerging results and open challenges that can inspire novel research
          directions
          and
          influence the future of KR research.
        </p>

        <p>
          We invite submissions of papers on all aspects of the development, deployment, and evaluation of KR tools and
          techniques
          to solve application problems, including:
        <ul>
          <li>System descriptions including the description of algorithmic techniques, heuristics, and optimizations for
            established systems</li>
          <li>Case studies, including descriptions of the problem setting, data and tools used, and "lessons learned"
          </li>
          <li>Assessments and reports of experimental studies, rigorously assessing aspects such as scalability,
            usability,
            acceptance, and uptake</li>
          <li>Benchmarks and resources that may support the assessment of KR tools, such as data sets, collections of

        <p>
          In the last decades, we have witnessed a proliferation of approaches that integrate several modelling,
          verification and
          simulation techniques, facilitating more versatile and efficient analysis of software-intensive systems. These
          approaches provide powerful support for the analysis of different functional and non-functional properties of
          the
          systems, complex interaction of components of different nature as well as validation of diverse aspects of
          system
          behaviour. The iFM conference series is a forum for discussing recent research advances in the development of
          integrated
          approaches to formal modelling and analysis. The conference covers all aspects of the design of integrated
          techniques,
          including language design, verification and validation, automated tool support and the use of such techniques
          in
          software engineering practice. To credit the effort of tool developers, we use EAPLS artifact badging.

        <p>
          The Verified Software Initiative (VSI), spearheaded by Tony Hoare and Jayadev Misra, is an ambitious research
          program
          for making large-scale verified software a practical reality. The International Conference on Verified
          Software:
          Theories, Tools and Experiments (VSTTE) is the main forum for advancing the initiative. VSTTE brings together
          experts
          spanning the spectrum of software verification in order to foster international collaboration on the critical
          research
          challenges. The theoretical work includes semantic foundations and logics for specification and verification,
          and
          verification algorithms and methodologies. The tools cover specification and annotation languages, program
          analyzers,
          model checkers, interactive verifiers and proof checkers, automated theorem provers and SAT/SMT solvers, and
          integrated
          verification environments. The experimental work drives the research agenda for theory and tools by taking on
          significant specification/verification exercises covering hardware, operating systems, compilers, computer
          security,
          parallel computing, and cyber-physical systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          VSTTE 2025 welcomes submissions describing significant advances in the production of verified software, i.e.
          software
          that has been proved to meet its functional specifications. Submissions of theoretical, practical, and
          experimental
          contributions are equally encouraged, including those that focus on specific problems or problem domains. We
          are
          especially interested in submissions describing large-scale verification efforts that involve collaboration,
          theory
          unification, tool integration, and formalized domain knowledge. We also welcome papers describing novel
          experiments and
          case studies evaluating verification techniques and technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to regular papers, we welcome submissions on in-progress verified software projects to a
          “work-in-progress
          (presentation-only)” track. Work-in-progress contributions will not appear in the post-proceedings of the
          conference.
          Submissions describing work of interest to the software verification community, but that could not be accepted
          for
          publication in the conference proceedings, may be invited to the “work-in-progress (presentation-only)” track,

        <h4>Track: Tests & Proofs</h4>
        <p>
          FM 2026 features a special track on Tests and Proofs (TAP) as a part
          of the conference.
        </p>

        <p>
          TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets
          the interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the
          ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.
        </p>

        <p>
          Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous
          techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of
          dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic
          techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are
          complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that
          provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and
          dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic
          execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or
          the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive
          enumeration. The verification of systems based on machine learning
          spurs novel combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g.,
          property verification of surrogate models that are generated through
          testing.
        </p>

        <p>
          TAP's scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology,
          including foundational work, tool development, and empirical research.
          Topics of interest center around the combination of static techniques
          such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.

        <p>
          GALOP is an international workshop on formal models for program interaction. It has a
          broad interest, in both the foundational aspects of these models as well as their
          practical applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          The central focus of GALOP is game semantics, a set of techniques used to represent the
          interaction of a program and its environment as a formal game. This is a powerful
          framework for reasoning about programs and interactive systems, and game semantics is
          relevant to many aspects of programming language theory. Game semantics also has deep
          connections to logic and other fields of mathematics.
        </p>

        <p>
          GALOP aims to gather researchers with a range of expertise who share an interest in
          reasoning about the interactive behaviour of programs using formal mathematical
          methods, in any context including proof theory, denotational semantics, or program
          verification. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
        <ul>
          <li>Games and other interaction-based denotational models</li>
          <li>Game-based program analysis and verification</li>
          <li>Logics for games and games for logics</li>
          <li>Algorithmic aspects of game semantics</li>

        <p>
          Symbolic Computation is concerned with the efficient algorithmic
          determination of exact solutions to complicated mathematical problems.
          Satisfiability Checking has recently started to tackle similar problems but
          with different algorithmic and technological solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The two communities share many central interests, but researchers from
          these two communities rarely interact. Also, the lack of common or
          compatible interfaces for tools is an obstacle to their fruitful
          combination. Bridges between the communities in the form of common
          platforms and road-maps are necessary to initiate an exchange, and to
          support and direct their interaction. The aim of this workshop is to
          provide an opportunity to discuss, share knowledge and experience across
          both communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          The workshop series has emerged from an H2020 FETOPEN CSA project
          "SC-Square", which ran from 2016 to 2018. It has been continued aiming at
          building bridges between Satisfiability Checking and Symbolic Computation.

        <p>
          UNIF 2025 is the 39th event in a series of international meetings
          devoted to unification theory and its applications. Unification is
          concerned with the problem of making two given terms equal, either
          syntactically or modulo an equational theory. It is a fundamental
          process used in various areas of computer science, including automated
          reasoning, term rewriting, logic programming, natural language
          processing, program analysis, knowledge representation, types, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          The International Workshop on Unification (UNIF) is a forum for
          researchers in unification theory and related fields to present recent
          (even unfinished) work, and to discuss new ideas and trends. It is also
          a good opportunity for students, young researchers and scientists working
          in related areas to get an overview of the current state of the art in
          unification theory.

          Determining the satisfiability of first-order formulas modulo background theories, known as the Satisfiability
          Modulo
          Theories (SMT) problem, has proved to be an enabling technology for verification, synthesis, test generation,
          compiler
          optimization, scheduling, and other areas. The success of SMT techniques depends on the development of both
          domain-specific decision procedures for each background theory (e.g., linear arithmetic, the theory of arrays,
          or
          the
          theory of bit-vectors) and combination methods that allow one to obtain more versatile SMT tools. These
          ingredients
          together make SMT techniques well-suited for use in larger automated reasoning and verification efforts.

          corpus of tools, approaches, and methodologies (proof nets,
          exponential decomposition, geometry of interaction, coherent spaces,
          relational models, etc.) that, even if developed for studying Linear
          Logic syntax and semantics, have been applied in several other fields

            Workshop
            on Recent Advances in Concurrency and Logic</a>, call for papers</h3>
        <div class="details">
          August 25, 2025, Aarhus, Denmark (satellite event of <a href="https://conferences.au.dk/confest2025">CONFEST

        </div>

        <p>
          RADICAL proposes a workshop aligned within the intersection between concurrency and logic, broadly construed.
          Admittedly
          broad, such an intersection has been explored from very diverse angles for many years now. More recently, the
          interplay
          of concurrency and logic with areas/applications such as, for instance:
        <ul>
          <li>Design, verification, synthesis for concurrent systems, both qualitative and quantitative;</li>
          <li>Strategic reasoning for distributed and multi-agent systems;</li>
          <li>Analysis and validation techniques for concurrent and distributed programs and systems (e.g., separation
            logic,
            advanced type systems, and runtime verification techniques);</li>
        </ul>
        has received much attention, as witnessed by recent CONCUR editions. These areas/applications have become
        increasingly
        consolidated, and start to have profound impact in neighboring communities such as
        <ul>
          <li>Programming languages;</li>
          <li>Artificial intelligence;</li>
          <li>Computer security;</li>
          <li>Knowledge representation;</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          As an unfortunate side effect, however, the important unifying role that concurrency plays in all of them
          seems hard
          to
          find in a single scientific event. Indeed, there do not seem to exist appropriate venues in which different
          research
          communities interested in concurrency and logic can meet closely, cross-fertilize, and share their most
          exciting
          recent
          results. RADICAL intends to fill a gap between CONCUR researchers that now also typically publish and interact
          in
          other
          different venues; it also aims at attracting researchers from neighboring communities whose work naturally
          intersects
          with CONCUR.

        <p>
          Building on the ideas of Floyd-Hoare logic, dynamic logic was introduced in the 70's as a formal tool for
          reasoning
          about, and verify, classic imperative programs. Over time, its aim has evolved and expanded; DL can be seen
          now as a
          general set of ideas and tools devised for representing, describing and reasoning about diverse kind of
          actions,
          including (but not limited to) frameworks tailored for specific programming problems/ paradigms (e.g.,
          separation
          logics), settings for modelling new computing domains (e.g., probabilistic, continuous and quantum
          computation),
          frameworks for reasoning about information dynamics (e.g., dynamic epistemic logics) and systems for reasoning
          about
          long term information dynamics (e.g., learning theory).
        </p>

        <p>
          Both its theoretical relevance and practical potential make DLs a topic of interest in a number of scientific
          venues,
          from wide-scope software engineering conferences to modal logic specific events. The aim of the DaLí 2025
          workshop is to
          bring together, in a single place, researchers with a shared interest in the formal study of actions (from
          Academia to
          Industry and more, from Mathematics to Computer Science and beyond) to present their work, foster discussions
          and
          encourage collaborations.

        <p>
          The Marktoberdorf Summer School is a 10-day event for young computer scientists and mathematicians, typically
          doctoral
          and postdoctoral researchers. It provides mini-courses on state-of-the-art topics in specification and
          verification and
          leaves ample room for interaction between participants and speakers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cybersecurity has become of fundamental importance for society. Today, computer systems are part of almost
          every
          artifact, from connected social media platforms to autonomous cars, internet commerces, or power plants. While
          the
          explosion in applications of computer systems leads to great increases in productivity and wealth, there are
          increasingly many scenarios showcasing that our complex cyberspace is not secure: software crashes, data
          breaches, and
          security vulnerabilities have become a fact of our daily life. Ensuring a secure cyberspace requires a
          multidisciplinary
          approach to specifying and verifying existing infrastructures. Computer science has therefore emerged into a
          social
          discipline, continuously developing new technologies for (dis)proving system security and examining user
          privacy,
          mechanically and efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 1970 the Marktoberdorf Summer School has attracted the best researchers on cybersecurity in the world.
          The
          Marktoberdorf Summer School 2025 will focus on presenting the latest developments toward the specification and
          verification of secure cyberspaces. The summer school will feature 12 courses by top researchers in the area.

          and understand connections between subdisciplines. ESSAI also offers several social activities for students
          and
          researchers alike. One of the tracks of ESSAI consists of advanced tutorials on a specific subject and
          corresponds
          to
          the traditional ACAI school organized by EurAI since 1989.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ESSAI 2025 will offer an intensive 5-day program featuring various AI courses and tutorials. With over 30

          The 2025 pseudo-Boolean competition is organized as a special event of the SAT 2025 conference.
          The goal is to assess the state of the art in the field of pseudo-Boolean solvers, in the same spirit as the
          previous
          competitions and evaluations
        </p>

        <h4>Call for Solvers</h4>
        <p>
          We encourage the submission of any kind of pseudo-Boolean solver (complete or incomplete solvers, sequential
          or
          parallel, working on linear or non-linear constraints, etc.). There are a few simple requirements to ensure
          that a
          submitted solver will correctly operate in the competition environment. It is expected that any pseudo-Boolean
          solver
          can be easily modified to conform to these requirements. People interested in submitting a solver can contact
          the
          organizers to get some help.

        <h4>Call for Benchmarks</h4>
        <p>
          Benchmarks may be submitted in any reasonable format. The organizers will do their best to translate the
          submitted
          benchmarks to the input format adopted for the competition. A benchmark submitted in the format of the
          competition will
          still be normalized to ensure consistency among all the input files.

          We would particularly appreciate the submission of:
        <ul>
          <li>Industrial benchmarks</li>
          <li>Benchmark generators (written in any reasonable language)</li>

          The objective of this PhD is to explore the way various NN-based architectures manage to approximate formal
          languages,
          i.e. learn surrogate automata from their traces. Beyond well established results on the expressive power of
          these
          models, the focus will be on the capabilities of the pair model + learning algorithm. Several authors have
          shown that
          almost discrete behaviors emerge naturally when NN are trained by automata traces, despite their definition as
          continuous state space systems, whence the name "soft automata." Another objective will be to assess the
          robustness and
          reliability of such NN-based models as automata approximators, by means of appropriate formal methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          Several research directions are envisioned, that will be adapted to the skills and wishes of the candidate. We
          mention
          some of them below.
        <ul>
          <li>Exploring the approximation abilities of recurrent neural networks (RNN). RNNs are good approximators of
            regular
            languages, but tend to build quasi discrete approximations resembling local automata or n-gram models. This
            property has
            to be further understood by examining how well RNN learn more complex languages, and by measuring the
            distance between
            the original language and the one approximated by the RNN. This is both an experimental and a theoretical
            direction, as
            no algorithms yet exist to estimate such distances.</li>
          <li>Exploring the robustness of the models learnt by RNN, to identify stable regions of their state space and
            unstable ones.
            The effect of extra data, missing data or poisoned data on such robustness also has to be characterized.
            This research
            track will also aim at learning more robust models, by enforcing properties of the hidden state space, or by
            enforcing
            specific safety properties.</li>
          <li>Replacing a true automaton by its RNN surrogate (used as a generative model for example) raises questions
            like its
            reliability. One would like to verify properties of runs produced by such soft automata, for example safety
            properties.
            Few algorithms yet exist for model checking such models, and they mostly focus on static feed-forward NN,
            not recurrent
            ones.</li>
          <li>Exploring the properties of other architectures. While RNN have a vanishing memory, other structures like
            GRU or LSTM
            provide longer term memory, not to mention Transformers or attention-based architectures. The approximation
            abilities of
            such models have to be better understood, in particular to characterize the family of languages they best
            suit. New NN
            architectures and learning algorithms will be explored, with the aim to better capture multiresolution
            features of a run
            that best predict the future of this run. For example to better learn hierarchical automata.</li>

          of Technology / the
          University of Gothenburg, Sweden</h3>

        <p>
          The student will work on the project "Symbolic Reactive Synthesis on Planning Domains” with Professor Nir
          Piterman. The
          student will join the formal methods unit, with currently 6 active PhD students. This position is supported by
          WASP
          (Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems, and Software Program) alongside 4 other positions to work with my
          colleagues Fredrik
          Johansson (Machine Learning), Hazem Torfah (Autonomous Systems), Gregory Gay (Software Testing), and Muoi Tran
          (Secure
          Networks).
        </p>

        <p>
          Research scope: formal methods, reactive synthesis, planning, automata, games, temporal logics.
        </p>

        <p>
          The successful candidate will work on the project “Symbolic Reactive Synthesis on Planning Domains”. Reactive
          synthesis
          - automatic production of programs from high-level descriptions of their desired behavior - is emerging as a
          viable tool
          for the development of robots and reactive software. In high level, this is like telling a robot what you
          would like it
          to do and automatically planning how to do it. Planning domain description language (PDDL) is a standard
          language used
          to specify planning problems and domains in artificial intelligence. It provides a way to define objects,
          actions, and
          goals for automated planning systems to solve complex tasks. The project will seek to combine usage of PDDL in
          reactive
          synthesis. This will include both theoretical and practical contributions.
        </p>

        <p>
          More concretely, the work will include the study of temporal logic, planning domains and planning techniques,
          automata,
          and two player games. Temporal logic and planning domains are used for describing in a high level the required
          behavior
          of a program, planning techniques are used to extract information about the problem, automata are used as an
          algorithmic
          tool for manipulation of logic formulae, and two-player games enable to consider strategies and programs. We
          will study
          these formalisms, analyze their properties, devise algorithms to manipulate and translate between them, as
          well as
          implement tools that will show the applicability of the developed techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
          The aim of the doctoral (third-cycle) education is to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to conduct
          independent
          research within computer science, and to contribute to the development of knowledge by writing a scholarly
          thesis.
        </p>

        <p>
          PhD (third-cycle) education is through a fixed-term employment contract for 5 years. During these 5 years,
          most of the
          student’s time will be devoted to their research. They will also be assisting the department’s education by
          working 20%
          of their time on a teaching or supporting role. The 20% support component may be concentrated in certain parts
          of the
          year according to department’s needs (in consultation with the student). In addition, the student will have to
          undertake
          60 Higher Education Credits (HECs) in courses enriching their knowledge in computer science, supporting their
          research,
          and gaining general (scientific) skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project is supported by WASP and the appointed student will also belong to the WASP graduate school. Some
          of the
          required HECs will be specialized WASP courses about autonomous systems and AI. The appointed student will
          also be
          eligible to participate in other WASP supported programs (such as visits to universities abroad or short-term

        <h3 id="CEA">PhD Position in Runtime Verification of Multi-State Properties, CEA LIST, Paris-Saclay, France</h3>

        <p>
          CEA List’s offices are located at the heart of Université Paris-Saclay, the largest European cluster of public
          and
          private research. Within CEA List, the Software Safety and Security Lab has an ambitious goal: help designers,
          developers and validation experts ship high-confidence systems and software.
        </p>

        <p>
          This PhD will be a collaboration between CEA List and Université d’Orléans in the context of a recently
          accepted
          research project. Therefore, the PhD student will also be a member of the Languages, Modeling, Verification
          (LMV) team
          of LIFO, the Laboratory of Fundamental Computer Science in Orléans, Université d’Orléans. The overall
          objective of the
          LMV team is to advance the reliability and security of software, particularly in the context of the Internet
          of Things
          (IoT). We aim to ensure that the software involved satisfies critical properties either by construction by
          leveraging
          the design of libraries and programming languages, or by using formal methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of the PhD consists in designing, formalizing, implementing, and proving correct new solutions for
          runtime
          checking of as many multi-state properties as possible. Currently, for the at construct, the state-of-the-art
          solutions
          for languages in which the size of any allocated blocks is statically known require to copy large pieces of
          program
          memory, which is not efficient. For languages in which the size of allocated block is not necessarily
          statically known,
          such as C, an equivalent solution would require to copy the whole program memory, which is not reasonable. In
          such a
          context, a solution might consist in including a static analysis that would approximate soundly the memory
          locations
          that would be copied at runtime. There is currently no solution for multi-state function/predicate calls.
        </p>

        <p>
          The designed solution will be implemented in E-ACSL and experimented in concrete use cases. In particular,
          supporting
          such constructs is required to support runtime verification of MetAcsl’s high-level properties, such as
          confidentiality
          and integrity properties. Among others, Thales uses MetAcsl to verify security properties of smard card’s
          virtual
          machine: this PhD thesis would help Thales to include E-ACSL in its verification toolchain.
        </p>

        <p>
          The formalization work and the proof of soundness will be done on a subset of C and ACSL, including the key
          constructs.
          Optionnally, they could be done within a proof assistant, such as Coq.
        </p>

        <p>
          Knowledge in the following fields is appreciated:
        <ul>
          <li>OCaml programming (at least, functional programming)</li>
          <li>C programming</li>
