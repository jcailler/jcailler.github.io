      <h2 id="Dowek">In Memoriam: Gilles Dowek</h2>
      <div class="details"><a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=184&lang=en">Maria Paola Bonacina</a> with
        <a href="https://blanqui.gitlabpages.inria.fr/">Frédéric Blanqui</a></div>

      <p>
        Gilles Dowek died on the 21st of July 2025, aged 58. He was diagnosed with lung cancer
        in early 2022. The sad news of his illness spread in the scientific community in the
        spring of that year, as he decided to let it be known. He fought the terrible illness
        with admirable courage, but had to succumb after over three years of resistance,
        leaving the automated reasoning community deeply saddened by such a premature loss.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gilles Dowek was a research director at INRIA, where he founded and led the Deducteam unit,
        and a professor at Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay. During his career, Gilles made numerous
        contributions to automated reasoning, logic, theoretical computer science, philosophy, and education.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gilles started as a student of Herbrand Award winner Gérard Huet, defending a thesis entitled
        "Démonstration Automatique dans le Calcul des Constructions" ("Automated Theorem Proving in the
        Calculus of Constructions") at Université Paris Diderot in 1991. He proceeded to develop a
        research program centered on deduction in higher order logic, solving several key problems
        about higher-order matching and higher-order unification. His chapter on "Higher-Order Unification
        and Matching" in the Handbook of Automated Reasoning (2001) summarized this part of his research.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together with Thérèse Hardin and Claude Kirchner, Gilles Dowek initiated the paradigm of deduction
        modulo, a powerful generalization of the classical concepts of unification and rewriting modulo
        an equational theory. With his PhD student Denis Cousineau, Gilles proved in 2007 that all
        functional pure type systems can be expressed in the lambda-Pi calculus modulo rewriting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gilles was concerned with balancing the advantages and disadvantages of the existence of the many
        different proof systems that are developed and used in the automated reasoning community.
        As mathematics becomes computerized, the variety of proof systems may even challenge the universality
        of mathematical truth. Thus, Gilles applied his leadership to start and promote the development
        of the Dedukti logical framework to encode and translate proofs from one proof system to another.
        To this end, he also inspired the creation of the EuroProofNet COST action (2021-2025).
      </p>

      <p>
        Gilles was a brilliant speaker, and many certainly remember the breadth and elegance of his IJCAR
        invited talk "From the universality of mathematical truth to the interoperability of proof systems,"
        given at Haifa, Israel, during the 2022 Federated Logic Conference. Gilles was already ill at that
        time, and, sadly, had to limit his conference participation, but for those who had the chance,
        his conversation during coffee break after his invited talk was as pleasant and gifted as always.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gilles was also an excellent teacher and supervised or co-supervised many PhD students. He authored
        several books presenting topics in computer science, logic, and philosophy to the general public.
        His commitment to teaching and his love for computer science led him to engage in promoting the teaching
        of computer science in high school, contributing to the definition of the corresponding curriculum.
        His many and diverse accomplishments were recognized by several awards from the French Academy of Sciences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together with Alessandro Armando and Peter Baumgartner, Gilles Dowek was Program Co-Chair of IJCAR 2008,
        hosted by Peter Baumgartner in Sydney, Australia. Then, he served as Program Chair of RTA-25 at the 2014
        Federated Logic Conference during the Vienna Summer of Logic. From 2021 to 2022, he was vice leader of
        Working Group 4 on proof libraries in the above mentioned EuroProofNet COST action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone who met him will miss his kindness, humour, and hindsight. His passing is a great loss for
        the automated reasoning community and beyond.

      <h2 id="Miller">In Memoriam: Peter B. Andrews</h2>
      <div class="details"><a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/">Dale Miller</a></div>

      <p>Peter B. Andrews, an American mathematician and Professor Emeritus at
        Carnegie Mellon University, passed away on April 21, 2025, at the age
        of 87. Andrews was a leading figure in the theory and applications of
        higher-order logic and automated reasoning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peter Andrews received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from Princeton
        University in 1964, where he was advised by the highly influential
        logician Alonzo Church. Andrews joined the Mathematics Department at
        Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh in 1963 and remained there
        for 49 years, retiring in 2012.
      </p>

      <p>
        Andrews's research was motivated by a desire to develop tools that
        could enhance human reasoning with a vision for the eventual
        formalization of virtually all mathematical, scientific, and technical
        knowledge, as well as the development of automated reasoning tools to
        assist in managing this knowledge. He made progress on this vision by
        focusing his work primarily on automated deduction within Church's
        version of higher-order logic based on the Simple Theory of Types.
      </p>

      <p>
        A major achievement in his career was leading the development of TPS
        (Theorem Proving System), an automated theorem prover for higher-order
        classical logic. A subsystem, ETPS (Educational Theorem Proving
        System), was created to help students learn logic by interactively
        constructing natural deduction proofs. Andrews worked on this system
        with his research assistants from 1974 until his retirement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Andrews also made significant contributions to the foundations of
        symbolic logic. He is notable for identifying a gap in Jacques
        Herbrand's proof of the eponymous Herbrand's theorem for first-order
        logic and corresponding with Burton Dreben about it. This
        collaboration led to a joint paper with Dreben and St\aa l Aanderaa in
        1963, which provided a counterexample to a key lemma in Herbrand's
        proof. It was later discovered that Kurt G\"odel had privately noted
        a similar error decades earlier, though he did not publish it.
        Andrews also noted an error in Leon Henkin's definition of general
        models for higher-order logic and provided a fix for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        His book ``An Introduction to Mathematical Logic and Type Theory: To
        Truth Through Proof,'' praised for its clear and concise presentation
        of logic, is one of the few textbooks that covers both the syntactic
        and semantic sides of higher-order logic using Church's Simple Theory
        of Types.
      </p>

      <p>
        In recognition of his significant contributions to automated
        deduction, Peter Andrews received the Herbrand Award in 2003. A
        Festschrift titled "Reasoning in Simple Type Theory" was published in
        2008 in honor of his 70th birthday.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peter is survived by his wife of nearly 40 years, Catherine Clair

      <h3 id="juergen">Nominee statement of J&uuml;rgen Giesl</h3>

      <p>
        In the last three years, I was CADE president. If I am re-elected, I will continue trying
        to ensure that CADE keeps on being the main conference for all research in the area of
        automated deduction. Therefore, the scope of CADE should remain as broad as possible.
        CADE should be open to any aspect of automated deduction and it should cover everything
        from theoretical results and practical contributions up to applications of automated
        reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also think that it is very important to attract tool submissions, and to organize tool
        competitions co-located with CADE. (Since its foundation in 2004, I have been active in
        the termination competition, which took place during IJCAR/CADE several times.)
      </p>
      <p>

        I think the current organization of CADE as a stand-alone event every
        second year, within IJCAR every other year, and within FLoC every four
        years is still a very good solution to guarantee the visibility of CADE on its
        own, while keeping in close contact with neighboring meetings and fields.
      </p>
      <p>

        Following the poll among the CADE community, I negotiated with LIPIcs to ensure
        that the proceedings CADE, as well as of IJCAR, TABLEAUX, and FroCoS will all be published
        as open access publications with LIPIcs from 2027 onwards.
      </p>
      <p>

        To attract as many participants as possible and to allow students
        to attend the conference, I think CADE should aim at affordable conference
        fees and continue the very good tradition of Woody Bledsoe travel grants
        for students.
      </p>
      <p>

        My own research is concerned with different aspects of
        automated deduction. Therefore, I have been attending
        and publishing papers at CADE since 1994. In particular,
        I am working on techniques and tools to analyze properties like
        termination or complexity of programs automatically.
      </p>
      <p>

        I was one of the PC chairs of IJCAR 2010, PC chair of RTA 2005,
        Steering Committee chair of RTA (2005-2007), Area Editor of
        ACM TOCL (since 2013), SC member of FSCD (since 2022),
        and I served many times on the PCs of CADE, IJCAR, RTA, LPAR, FSCD,
        and several other conferences in the field. I was CADE trustee
        from 2010-2011, 2014-2020, and 2022-2025, and CADE president since 2022.
      </p>

      <h3 id="claudia">Nominee statement of Cl&aacute;udia Nalon</h3>

      <p>
        I am honoured and excited to be nominated once again to serve on the CADE's Board of Trustees. I have
        contributed both
        research and tool papers to CADE and IJCAR, served as a PC member several times, and helped with the
        organisation of
        the first edition of CADE in South America. I also have experience as a PC member, chair, SC member and
        organiser for
        other conferences in our field.
      </p>
      <p>

        My research is focused on both the theoretical foundations and practical aspects of implementing proof methods
        for
        non-classical logics and their combinations. CADE and IJCAR are (and should remain) welcoming venues for
        research
        encompassing a broad range of logics and techniques. I feel at home here and I am deeply committed to this
        community.
        As an enthusiastic implementer, I advocate for increasing the number of system and tool paper submissions, and
        for
        introducing demo sessions for tools at the conference. This is important not only in my field, but more
        generally, as
        it encourages and celebrates the hard work involved in producing these tools.
      </p>
      <p>

        I strongly believe that a better geographical distribution of conference sites for CADE would be beneficial to
        our
        community. It would help to stimulate research, disseminate knowledge about automated reasoning, and also
        attract
        talented individuals from regions that are currently not well represented in our field. We should remain
        sensitive to
        the fact that funding in those areas is often limited, and both researchers and students may have difficulties
        with
        meeting travel expenses and registration fees. I therefore support continuing the Bledsoe Award to support
        students,
        while also exploring options for reduced registration fees for participants in less favoured regions.
      </p>
      <p>

        Thank you for considering my nomination. I am looking forward to the opportunity to continue contributing to our
        community.
      </p>


      <h3 id="andre">Nominee statement of Andr&eacute; Platzer</h3>

      <p>
        I am a strong proponent of Open Access publications to give all researchers access to CADE findings. That is why
        my
        PC-co-chair Geoff Sutcliffe and conference co-chair Marijn Heule took the initiative to make CADE-28 Open
        Access.
        Listening to extended community input, CADE now fortunately has a longer term Open Access plan beyond individual
        conferences, which, of course, should be monitored carefully to keep it successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        CADE should continue its traditional strength of being particularly warm and welcoming to young researchers,
        which is
        also a role that the automated reasoning school can help facilitate. This summer school is a great opportunity
        to
        enable PhD students to pick up interesting background and grow into an international young scientists community.
      </p>
      <p>

        The third challenge is how to help spread the voice of automated deduction in the broader logic community and
        the
        scientific community beyond. I believe this is is important, because automated deduction has a lot to offer in
        the
        significant topics of logic.
      </p>
      <p>

        <em>My background:</em>
        I am the Alexander von Humboldt Professor for Logic of Autonomous Dynamical Systems at Karlsruhe Institute of
        Technology (KIT) and founded the Logical Systems Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. My research characterizes
        the
        logical foundations of cyber-physical systems and answers the question how we can trust a computer to control
        physical
        processes. The solution to this challenge is the key to enabling computer assistance that we can bet our lives
        on. I
        pursue this challenge with the principled design of programming languages with logics that can provide proofs as
        correctness guarantees, such as in our KeYmaera theorem provers.
      </p>
      <p>

        I have contributed as an author to CADE/IJCAR (where the largest percentage of my papers are published), shared
        my
        views on logic and proofs in an invited talk at IJCAR 2016, served on several CADE/IJCAR PCs, and have been
        co-chair
        of CADE-28 in 2021. I serve on the editorial board of the Journal of Automated Reasoning, Acta Informatica, and
        the
        ACM Formal Aspects of Computing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="viorica">Nominee statement of Viorica Sofronie-Stokkermans</h3>

      <p>
        My research covers various aspects of automated reasoning, including
        theory and applications. I have been attending CADE and IJCAR regularly,
        and I served on several of their PCs. I was program co-chair of CADE-23
        (with Nikolaj Bj&oslash;rner), program co-chair of IJCAR 2020 (with Nicolas Peltier),
        and conference chair of FroCoS 2011. I was honored to serve as a CADE
        trustee ex-officio (as CADE-23 program co-chair) and from 2011 to 2014.
      </p>
      <p>

        CADE and IJCAR have the crucial role of stimulating important research
        in the area of automated reasoning; they are the major forum for discussing
        all aspects of automated theorem proving, including theory, implementations
        and applications. To ensure CADE's leading position in the field it is important
        to make clear that every area of automated reasoning is welcome at CADE.
        As a CADE trustee, I would work towards ensuring that the scope of CADE
        is kept as broad as possible.
      </p>
      <p>

        I support encouraging tool submissions and submissions that demonstrate
        the impact of new or existing methods and tools on solving relevant problems.
        In this context, I think that artifact evaluation and making the tools available
        to the community is very important.
      </p>
      <p>

        I believe that the current cycle of conferences (CADE alternating with IJCAR,
        and IJCAR as a part of FLoC every four years) is the right way to continue,
        since this guarantees the visibility of CADE while allowing close contact,
        convergence and interaction with related conferences within IJCAR, as well
        as interaction with the conferences in FLoC. To enhance the awareness of
        the importance of the research on automated reasoning, it is important to also
        strengthen the connection to top conferences in related areas outside FLoC
        (ETAPS conferences, IJCAI, ISSAC, POPL).
      </p>
      <p>

        To attract participants, I think CADE should aim at having affordable conference fees.
        Although physical presence at a conference is desirable and very important,
        I believe that the possibility of registration at a lower fee for online participation,
        or the possibility of following online at least part of the talks should be seriously
        considered.
      </p>
      <p>

        The future of the automated reasoning community relies on students and young
        researchers. Therefore we will have to continue finding ways to attract the best
        students and provide a stimulating atmosphere for them at CADE.
        Lower registration fees for students and Woody Bledsoe travel awards are important,
        since they make participation of young researchers easier.
        Organizing summer schools co-located with CADE would be a further possibility
        of attracting students at an even earlier phase, in which they start looking for
        research topics. In addition, mentoring workshops, or application-oriented events
        co-located with CADE could increase the impact of the conference on researchers
        at the beginning of their careers.
      </p>

      <h3 id="sophie">Nominee statement of Sophie Tourret</h3>

      <p>
        It has been an honor to serve in the CADE board of trustees from 2022 to
        now. During that time, I have been an active supporter of the move to
        LIPIcs that will finally occur at CADE 2027. I have also been involved
        in the organisation of several CADE and IJCAR in succession, as PC
        member and as workshop or publicity chair and workshop organizer. Thanks
        to IJCAR 2024 taking place in Nancy, preceded by the SAT/SMT/AR summer
        school that I co-chaired, I also got to appreciate the amount of
        planning and efforts required to organize the events that make our
        community alive.
      </p>
      <p>

        These last few years my research interests have mostly been on the
        formalization of theoretical frameworks related to AR in Isabelle/HOL.
        This has brought me closer to the world of interactive theorem proving,
        that is ever present at CADE. I am also working on various other fun
        projects including higher-order SMT instantiation, abduction, that I keep
        returning to under different forms since my PhD days, and more exotic
        and/or applied topics such as applying theorem provers to quantum string
        diagram transformations.
      </p>
      <p>

        In the past and in the future, one of the points I have paid and will
        continue to pay attention to is the communication and interactions
        between the different components of our community. As the (former) AAR
        newsletter editor, I was often contacting organizers of conferences and
        workshops to ask for CfPs before newsletter deadlines. Now, as part of
        the steering committee of the SAT/SMT/AR summer school, I am committed to
        making this event happen each year in the best possible conditions that
        is, in my opinion, coordinated with one of its related conferences, to
        contribute to bringing the state of the art of automated reasoning to
        new generations of researchers.
      </p>
      <p>

        For the same reason, I am very favorable to the alternance between CADE
        and IJCAR with FLoC occurring every four years, and if there is a
        possibility of co-location on CADE years, I plan to favor that option
        other things being equal.
      </p>
      <p>

        I really enjoy the balance between theory and practice at CADE, as well
        as the friendly and open atmosphere of our community. As a CADE trustee,
        I will strive to preserve these strengths of ours.
      </p>

      <h3 id="uwe">Nominee statement of Uwe Waldmann</h3>

      <p>
        I feel honored to be nominated for the CADE Board of Trustees. Working
        mainly on saturation-based proof calculi and systems, I consider CADE
        my home conference. I had my first CADE paper in 1996, visited almost
        every CADE since 1990, participated in 10 of the last 13 CADE and
        IJCAR program committees, and co-chaired CADE-30.
      </p>
      <p>

        I am generally happy with the development of CADE in the last decades.
        The regular alternation between CADE and IJCAR, the co-locations with
        other conferences, and the large range of workshops are important to
        foster cooperations with researchers from neighboring communities.
        Measures to support and promote young scientists help to keep the field
        of automated deduction alive and should be continued. To remain the
        leading conference in our field, the spectrum of possible topics for
        CADE must stay broad and theoretical papers, practical papers, and
        application papers must be equally welcome. In order to attract
        scientists from outside Europe, it is also important that CADE takes
        place on other continents on a regular basis.

            Knowledge

        <div class="details">November 11-17, 2025, Melbourne, Australia</div>
        <p>
          Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and vibrant field of research within
          Artificial
          Intelligence. KR builds on the fundamental thesis that knowledge can often be represented in an explicit
          declarative
          form, suitable for processing by dedicated symbolic reasoning engines. This enables the exploitation of
          knowledge
          that
          would otherwise be implicit through semantically grounded inference mechanisms. KR has contributed to the
          theory and
          practice of various areas of AI, including agents, automated planning, robotics and natural language
          processing, and
          to
          fields beyond AI, including data management, semantic web, verification, software engineering, computational
          biology,
          and cybersecurity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely, in-depth presentation of progress in the theory and
          practice
          of the representation and computational management of knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          KR 2025 will include three special thematic tracks (KR&R in Planning & Scheduling, KR and Constraints, KR in
          the
          Wild),
          a Video Track, a Recently Published Research Track, tutorials, workshops, and a Doctoral Consortium.

        <p><b><a href="https://krarlab.dmi.unipg.it/krrtrack/2026/">Track on Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
              (KRR)</a></b></p>
        <p>
          The KRR track covers an important field of research in Artificial Intelligence. Knowledge Representation and
          Reasoning
          is a trending topic (for instance, its Argumentation-theory subfield). A similar dedicated conference is the
          International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, but all the major AI
          conferences
          (AAAI, IJCAI, AAMAS, ECAI) have KRR among their topics of interest. This track will be a venue for researchers
          and
          practitioners working on the fundaments and applications of reasoning, and on the cross-fertilization among
          different
          approaches (e.g., Argumentation and Belief Revision).
        </p>

        <p>
          Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) focuses on designing computer representations that capture
          information
          about the world to solve complex problems. Its goal is to build intelligent behavior from the top down,
          focusing on
          what an agent needs to know, how this knowledge can be represented symbolically, and how automated reasoning
          procedures can make it available. In KRR, knowledge is represented in a declarative form, suitable for
          reasoning
          engines.
        </p>

        <p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Argumentation</li>
          <li>Constraint solving, programming, technologies</li>

          The Software Verification and Testing track aims to contribute to the challenge of improving the usability of
          formal
          methods in software engineering. The track covers areas such as formal methods for verification and testing,
          based on
          theorem proving, model checking, static analysis, and run-time verification. We invite authors to submit new

            ESSLLI 2026: European Summer School for Logic, Language, and Information 2026</a>, call for lectures and
          workshops
        </h3>

        <div class="details">
          Summer 2026, Prague, Czech Republic
        </div>

        <p>
          Under the auspices of the Association for Logic, Language, and Information (FoLLI), the European Summer School
          in Logic,
          Language, and Information (ESSLLI) runs every year. Except for 2021, when the school was virtual, it runs in a
          different
          European country each year. It takes place over two weeks in the summer, hosts approximately 50 different
          courses at
          levels that run from foundational to introductory to advanced, and attracts around 400 participants from all
          over the
          world. In 2026, ESSLLI returns to Prague after exactly 30 years.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 1989, ESSLLI has been providing outstanding interdisciplinary educational opportunities in the fields of
          Computer
          Science, Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Logic, Philosophy, and beyond. It comes from a community which
          recognizes that
          advances in our common areas require the contributions of multiple interrelated disciplines.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main focus of ESSLLI is the interface between linguistics, logic and computation, with special emphasis on
          human
          linguistic and cognitive ability. Courses, both introductory and advanced, cover a wide variety of topics
          within the
          combined areas of interest: Logic and Computation, Computation and Language, and Language and Logic. Workshops
          are also
          organized, providing opportunities for in-depth discussion of issues at the forefront of research, as well as
          a series
          of invited evening lectures.
        </p>

        <p><b>Topics and Format</b></p>
        <p>
          Proposals for courses and workshops at ESSLLI 2026 are invited in all areas of Logic, Linguistics and Computer
          Science.
          Cross-disciplinary and innovative topics are particularly encouraged.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each course and workshop will consist of five 90 minute sessions, offered daily (Monday-Friday) in a single
          week.
          Proposals for two-week courses should be structured and submitted as two independent one-week courses, e.g. as
          an
          introductory course followed by an advanced one. In such cases, the ESSLLI Program Committee reserves the
          right to
          accept just one of the two proposals.
        </p>

        <p><b>Categories</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Foundational Courses: Basics of a field, requiring no prior knowledge.</li>
          <li>Introductory Courses: Broad introductions suitable for non-specialists and young researchers.</li>
          <li>Advanced Courses: Graduate-level courses focusing on current research.</li>
          <li>Workshops: Specialized, topical meetings with contributed papers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Proposal Guidelines</b></p>
        <p>
          Course and Workshop proposals can be submitted by no more than two lecturers/organizers and can be presented
          by no more
          than these two lecturers/organizers. Two is actually the preferred number of lecturers/organizers, to secure
          the
          course/workshop against unexpected unavailability. All instructors and organizers must possess a PhD or
          equivalent
          degree by the submission deadline.
        </p>

        <p>
          Course proposals should mention explicitly the intended course category. Proposals for introductory courses
          should
          indicate the intended level, for example as it relates to standard textbooks and monographs in the area.
          Proposals for
          advanced courses should specify the prerequisites in detail.

        <p>
          FM 2026 is the 27th international symposium on Formal Methods in a series organized by Formal Methods Europe
          (FME), an
          independent association whose aim is to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for software
          development.
          The FM symposia have been successful in bringing together researchers and industrial users around a program of
          original
          papers on research and industrial experience, workshops, tutorials, reports on tools, projects, and ongoing
          doctoral
          research.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are inviting proposals for tutorials to complement the main FM 2026 symposium. The primary goal of these
          tutorials is
          to convey ideas with a focus on pedagogy over technical innovation. They offer a valuable platform for
          participants to
          discuss technical challenges, exchange research concepts, explore educational strategies, and demonstrate or
          investigate
          practical applications. Tutorials should be designed to be broadly accessible and pedagogically oriented,
          clarifying key
          concepts, building intuition, and ensuring ease of understanding. They aim to attract new researchers, serve
          as
          bridges
          to practitioners, and disseminate useful ideas widely. These may be driven by fundamental academic interests,
          or
          by
          needs from specific application domains.
        </p>

        <p>We encourage a diversity of topics relating to different ways of developing and using formal methods as well
          as
          all
          theoretical aspects of software engineering, including complex applications. Although tutorials focused on
          tools
          are a
          traditional choice, tutorials covering techniques are also welcome. Authors interested in proposing different
          types of
          tutorials are encouraged to contact the chairs for guidance. Overall, we welcome a broad range of tutorial
          topics,
          as
          long as they are relevant to the interests of the formal methods community. Moreover, we also invite topics at
          the
          intersection of machine learning and formal methods due to the growing interest in AI and machine
          learning-based
          software development.</p>

        <p>Accepted tutorial papers will be published in the conference proceeding volume. Authors of these papers will
          be
          allocated a presentation slot during the tutorial sessions prior to the main conference. When submitting
          tutorial
          papers, authors should indicate their preferred presentation length, which can be either half a day or a full
          day.

        </h3>
        <div class="details">Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence (AMAI)</div>

        <p>
          This special issue of the <i>Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence</i> (AMAI)
          is devoted to formal computational aspects of geometry. Geometry is a privileged field of investigation
          for various domains of computer science, from image processing to geometric modeling, artificial intelligence,
          education, automated proof in geometry, and semantic indexation of multimedia databases.
        </p>

        <p>
          This special issue of AMAI is devoted to formal computational aspects
          of geometry. Computer supported geometry can be investigated in
          several different ways. At the beginning of the 1960s, the seminal
          work of Gelernter in the domain of automated proof was about synthetic
          geometry as taught in school. Then, in the late 1970s, a kind of
          revolution occurred with the work of Wu, consisting in translating
          geometry into algebra and in using pseudo-division to perform proofs
          of a high-level theorem in both Euclidean and hyperbolic
          geometries. Subsequently, much work has been done continuing that
          geometry/algebra relation by considering other aspects of geometry,
          like differential geometry, distance geometry, discovering geometric
          theorems in figures with dynamic geometry software or from graphical
          figures, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, several researchers studied the foundations of geometry
          through various sets of axioms; this way, the classical axiomatic
          approaches of Hilbert and Tarski have been formalized, as well as
          computational origami or incidence geometry. Outside the domain of
          automated and formalized proof, computer supported geometry is also
          encountered almost everywhere in geometric modeling -- for instance
          with geometric constraint solving, declarative modeling, or topological
          modeling -- and also in computational geometry or combinatorial
          geometry.
        </p>

        <p>For this special issue of AMAI, we are seeking original contributions
          on various aspects of computer supported geometry. Relevant topics
          include (but are not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Probabilistic, synthetic, and logical approaches for deductive geometric reasoning</li>
          <li>Polynomial algebra, invariant and coordinate-free methods</li>

        <div class="details">Journal of Logic and Computation</div>

        <p>
          Proof-theoretic semantics (P-tS) offers a foundational shift in logic, prioritizing inference over truth
          conditions and
          emphasizing the centrality of proof in the assignment of meaning. This inferential perspective is naturally
          aligned with
          computational approaches, yet the intersection of P-tS and computation remains comparatively underexplored.
        </p>

        <p>
          This special issue of the Journal of Logic and Computation seeks to fill that gap by bringing together work at
          the
          interface of logic, computer science, and philosophy. We invite contributions that illuminate how
          computational
          interpretations of logic interact with proof-theoretic approaches, both conceptually and practically.

        <p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The computational content of proof-theoretic semantics</li>

        <p>
          The SCML publishing forum is dedicated to research combining Symbolic Computation (SC) and Machine Learning
          (ML) as
          two major approaches to artificial intelligence. We particularly welcome work on the application of ML to SC,
          the
          application of SC to ML, and hybrid combinations of the two. Submissions must explore the interaction between
          SC and
          ML rather than standalone work in either area.
        </p>

        <p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Applying ML to computer mathematics, algebra, and geometry; integrating ML into mathematical software
            systems
          </li>
          <li>Applying ML to automated reasoning, theorem proving, satisfiability solving; integrating ML into provers
          </li>
          <li>Applying ML to program synthesis; integrating ML into program verification</li>
          <li>Applying SC to analyzing and verifying ML models (“explainable AI”, “verified AI”)</li>
          <li>Applying SC to synthesizing ML models with guarantees of robustness and correctness</li>
          <li>Integrating SC capabilities (computer algebra, automated reasoning) into ML models</li>
          <li>Using LLMs for formalization of mathematical texts, natural language interfaces to SC systems, or
            education</li>
          <li>Combining linguistic reasoning (LLMs) with formal reasoning (theorem provers)</li>
          <li>Software and system descriptions, datasets, benchmarks, and metrics related to SC–ML interplay</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          SCML primarily solicits original research papers but also accepts surveys and position papers offering new
          perspectives on the interaction of SC and ML.

        <p>
          This SNSF-funded project investigates fixed points, recursive definitions, and proofs by induction,
          which are essential concepts in mathematics and computer science. A novel approach to formal proofs,
          non-wellfounded and cyclic proofs, has recently gained attention. These proofs provide a formal
          counterpart to proofs by infinite descent, with proof branches that are not well-founded but still satisfy
          global soundness conditions. The project aims at developing a deeper understanding of the structural
          properties of such proof systems.

        <p>
          I had a paper in the Springer LNCS this spring which was carefully
          prepared with the macro package for Springer Computer Science proceedings.
          As most of you might know, an accepted paper is forwarded to <em>Straive</em>,
          an Indian company who does what they call <em>proof editing and type
            setting</em> on behalf of Springer. The result is sent to the corresponding
          author who is asked to approve the produced version or to send corrections
          otherwise. <em>Straive</em> put 27 bugs into the paper which made almost 1.3
          bugs per page, viz. wrong use of capital letters, non-standard
          hyphenations and missing separation of lines. Some (but not all) headings
          and captions where provided with an additional period whereas a period at
          the end of a sentence had been removed. The paper had 2 tables with
          centered entries, some of them were left aligned, other right aligned and
          some remained centered (counting as 2 bugs) after <em>Straive</em> had put
          it hands on it. The layout was poor as the modified paper hat some pages
          with empty space. Finally, spurious spaces had been inserted at several
          places. I sent my corrections and asked for the corrected version which I
          never received, simply because nothing had been corrected and the paper with
          all the <em>Straive</em> bugs went to print.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, I had a paper in Springer's <em>Journal of Automated
            Reasoning</em> (JAR) which also went to <em>Straive</em>. After a while, I got the
          <em>proof edited and type setted</em> version with 122 bugs being
          introduced by <em>Straive</em> (it were more as I discovered later). There
          were also required corrections: I used <em>Sec.</em> as abbreviation for <em>
            Section</em> which <em>Straive</em> replaced with <em>Sect.</em> and the <em>
            Acknowledgement</em> had been relocated to a position conforming to the JAR
          standards—nothing else needed a change. But where did all the other
          changes came from? Why did the <em>Straive</em> people put their hands on the
          TEX-source?
        </p>

        <p>
          However, whereas I had to grant the publication rights to Springer before I
          saw the spoiled version of the LNCS paper, I was asked to grant the
          publication rights (and—more important—to care for payment) later. Hence
          I refused to sign the forms until a bug free version of the paper intended
          for print were available. This provoked some discussion with Springer as
          such a procedure does not conform to Springer's publication workflow. But
          why bother? As I insisted in my position, a sequence of 6 iterations
          begun. Each time I got a new “corrected” version, I had to scan the whole
          paper to check whether the identified bugs had been removed and to mark the
          new bugs <em>Straive</em> had put into the “correction”. I send my corrections back
          after 4 working days at most, but the whole process lasted over 3 month.
          In total, I identified 255 bugs which <em>Straive</em> had put into the
          paper (making more than 5.3 per page), and 240 had been corrected (as I
          could live with the remaining 15 bugs and did not want to risk the
          insertion of new bugs if I insist in a further correction), to wit
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Printing beyond the page margins.</li>
          <li>Different font sizes in the running text and in the figures in
            particular.</li>
          <li>Poor layout (lines with large gaps between words, large gaps between
            paragraphs, unreadable formulas by insertion of linebreaks).</li>
          <li>Plain TEX-code appeared in print.</li>
          <li>Required spaces removed and unnecessary spaces inserted.</li>
          <li>Required punctuation removed and unnecessary punctuation inserted.</li>
          <li>Frequent font changes (replacement of <code>\mathit{...}</code> with
            <code>$...$</code> in particular so that e.g. <code>\mathit{fail}</code> now
            was displayed as <code>$fail$</code>).
          </li>
          <li>Modification of the TEX-code for operators making them meaningless.</li>
          <li>Replacement of parentheses with square brackets and vice versa.</li>
          <li>Words enclosed in apostrophes for no reason.</li>
          <li>Upper case letters changed to lower case and vice versa.</li>
          <li>Strange hyphenations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Maybe my recent experiences with Springer was extreme, but I hardly believe
          that I am the only victim of the <em>Straive</em> people and Springer's
          non-existent quality control. If others have made similar experiences, the
          community should think of whether it would be better if its flagship journal
          and the main conference proceedings would be published elsewhere. Also the
          requirement of having printed journals and conference proceedings belongs to
          the pre-internet era. It is enough to put an accepted paper for free
          download on the server of some internationally recognized institution like
          Dagstuhl and to rise a publication fee of e.g. 50–100 € /US $ for
          authors to cover the administration expenses of such an online journal.
        </p>

        <p>
          We all have enough duties in our daily work and need no additional burden by
          correcting the bugs others put into our papers. Future authors and
          conference chairs would benefit from a change.
