I love science promotion, and I thin that sharing science with everyone is a essential part of our work. 
I participated to a few (french) contests of science promotion ((and surprisingly win)), namely [MT180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdVQyov38sQ) and [5 minutes to convince](/assets/pdf/5_minutes_pour_convaincre.pdf).

I also play an active role in the organization of events for the general public such as open days or science festival. You can find an illustration of the riddles of the [Princess and the tiger](/assets/pdf/tiger.pdf), as well as the [Dreadbury Mansion](/assets/pdf/agatha.pdf).

I also give talks in high school to introduce and promote research to students, especially towards [girls](https://filles-et-maths.fr/).
