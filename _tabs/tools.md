### [Go√©land](https://github.com/GoelandProver/Goeland) üê¶

Work done in collaboration with [David Delahaye](https://www.lirmm.fr/~delahaye/), [Isaac Llu√≠s](http://isaac-lluis.com/) and [Johann Rosain](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/johann.rosain/). 

Go√©land is an automated theorem prover for first-order logic with equality. It relies on a
concurrent proof-search procedure based on the method of free-variable analytics tableaux that
allows it to perform a fair branch exploration. The prover is also able to deal with axiomatisable
theories thanks to a module of deduction modulo theory, to deal with polymorphic types,
and to produce machine-checkable proofs in Coq, Lambdapi and Lisa.

### [SC-TPTP Utilities](https://github.com/SC-TPTP/sc-tptp) üìú

Work done in collaboration with [Simon Guilloud](https://simonguilloud.ch/).

SC-TPTP Utilities is a library of tools able to deal with the SC-TPTP format. It includes softwares able to handle, import, export and transform proofs in SC-TPTP format, to add intermediate proof steps, and to export them into Rocq.

### [LastButNotLeast](https://github.com/jcailler/LastButNotLeast/) üèÜ

The fastest way to give up ‚Äî now with 0 bugs! Probably the fastest prover in the competition:
* Runs flawlessly.
* Achieves absolutely nothing.
* 100% success rate in failure.
* Zero proof, infinite potential.
* Proudly earns you a cool CASC T-shirt.

Unfortunately, designing this prover may force you to share a meal with very weird people ‚Äî but hey, that's the price of true innovation.

The strategy is simple: always return GaveUp. It's fast, reliable, and guarantees we never solve anything ‚Äî by design.

The prover is expected to come last at [CASC competition](https://tptp.org/CASC/), and any other result would be genuinely surprising ‚Äî possibly even concerning. In fact, LastButNotLeast proudly exists to ensure that no other prover ‚Äî no matter how underwhelming ‚Äî has to carry the burden of being last.

### [Capex](https://www.docamex.fr/docamex_portail/accueil) üßÄ

Capex is a knowledge-based multicriteria decision support tool that structures expert know-how to support technological decision-making in biomass transformation. It was initially applied to French cheese production under AOP/IGP, where preserving and transmitting specialized know-how is critical. By organizing this collective expertise into a structured knowledge base, Capex helps guide practical technological choices and supports the training of technicians and operators.
