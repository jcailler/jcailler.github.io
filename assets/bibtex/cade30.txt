abstract = {We introduce SC-TPTP, an extension of the TPTP derivation format that supports sequent formalism, enabling seamless proof exchange between interactive theorem provers and first-order automated theorem provers. We provide a way to represent non-deductive steps—Skolemization, clausification, and Tseitin normal form—as deductive steps within the format. Building upon the existing support in the Lisa proof assistant and the Go\'{e}land theorem prover, SC-TPTP ecosystem is further enhanced with proof output interfaces for Egg and Prover9, as well as proof reconstruction support for HOL Light, Lean, and Rocq.},
