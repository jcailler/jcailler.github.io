      <p>
        UNESCO proclaimed 14 January to be World Logic Day, a global day of
        supporting the development of logic through teaching and research, as well
        as to public dissemination of the discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
        The coordination of World Logic Day 2025 is --for the 5th time-- in the hands of the Conseil International de
        Philosophie et des Sciences Humaines (CIPSH) and its member organization, the Division for Logic, Methodology
        and Philosophy of Science and Technology of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science and
        Technology (DLMPST/IUHPST): see <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/days/world-logic">here</a> and <a
          href="http://wld.cipsh.international/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have learned over the last years that online meetings are easier to finance, better for the environment, and
        considerably more inclusive. So consider both in person and online events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Events will be listed on the <a href="http://wld.cipsh.international/">CIPSH website</a>.
      </p>

        To be added to that list, follow the instructions <a

            CADE is the major international forum for presenting research on all aspects
            of automated deduction. High-quality submissions on the general topic of
            automated deduction, including logical foundations, theory and principles,
            applications in and beyond computer science and mathematics, and
            implementations of automated reasoning systems are solicited. CADE-30 aims
            to present research that reflects the broad range of interesting and relevant
            topics in automated deduction.

          LICS also invites proposals for workshops on topics of interest to the LICS conference. Typically, LICS
          workshops feature a
          number of invited speakers and a number of contributed presentations. LICS workshops do not usually produce
          formal
          proceedings. However, in the past there have been special issues of journals based in part on certain LICS
          workshops.
          The conference will provide a room, internet connection and help with some local organization. The workshops
          selection
          committee consists of the LICS Workshops Chair (Valentin Blot), the LICS General Chair, the LICS PC Chairs and
          the LICS
          Conference Chairs.

        <p>
          The conference covers all aspects of formal structures for computation and deduction, from theoretical
          foundations to
          applications. Building on two communities, RTA (Rewriting Techniques and Applications) and TLCA (Typed Lambda
          Calculi and Applications), FSCD embraces their core topics and broadens their scope to closely related areas
          in logic, models of computation, semantics and verification in new challenging areas.

          The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission-critical and safety-critical systems at NASA and in
          the
          aerospace industry requires advanced technologies to address their specification, design, verification,
          validation, and
          certification. The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is a forum to foster collaboration between theoreticians and
          practitioners from NASA, other government agencies, academia, and industry, with the goal of identifying
          challenges and
          providing solutions towards achieving assurance for such critical systems. The focus of this symposium is on
          formal
          techniques for software and system assurance for applications in space, aviation, robotics, and other
          NASA-relevant
          critical systems.

        <p>
          The ANU Logic Summer School is an annual event that offers a two week long programme of lectures on modern
          logic, the
          foundational discipline of the information sciences. Topics include not only the science of reasoning but also
          computability theory, type theory and other tools for understanding processes, declarative programming,
          automatic proof
          generation, program verification and much more. The school is primarily geared at late undergraduate and
          masters
          students, but is open to all, including postgraduate and PhD students, postdocs, and participants from
          industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          The school features four introductory courses in the first week, and a series of five lectures covering more
          advanced
          topics in the second week. The courses are given by a mix of local, domestic and international speakers.

        <div class="details">Special Issue on Recent Advances on Unification</div>
        <p>
          The Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming (JLAMP) is
          an international journal that complements Elsevier's Science of Computer
          Programming and Theoretical Computer Science by its focus on the foundations
          and the application of logical, algebraic and categorical methods to
          programming and to the development of trustworthy computing systems. The aim
          of JLAMP special issues is to attract high-quality research papers in
          specific topics connected to logical and algebraic methods in the theory and
          practice of software development and computing systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose of this special issue of JLAMP is to collect recent, original,
          and high-quality contributions on unification theory and its applications,
          as well as closely related topics. Unification is concerned with the problem
          of making two given terms equal, either syntactically or modulo an equational
          theory. It is a fundamental process used in various areas of computer science,
          including automated reasoning, term rewriting, logic programming, natural
          language processing, program analysis, knowledge representation, types, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          The International Workshop on Unification (UNIF) is the main international
          event on unification. This special issue is related to the research presented
          in the last four editions of the workshop, i.e., from UNIF 2021 to UNIF 2024.
          Nevertheless, submissions of high quality works on unification that were not
          presented at UNIF are also welcome. Thus, participants of UNIF, as well as
          other authors, are invited to submit contributions.
        </p>

        <p>Following the tradition of UNIF, this special issue addresses the topic of unification in a broad sense. A
          non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Syntactic and equational unification algorithms</li>
          <li>Matching and constraint solving</li>
          <li>Higher-order unification</li>
          <li>Unification in modal, temporal, and description logics</li>
          <li>Admissibility of inference rules</li>
          <li>Narrowing</li>
          <li>Disunification</li>

          The aim of this topical collection is to collect, in a single volume, current state of the art research in
          Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). The collection is intended to include extended versions of papers that
          appeared in

        </p>

        <p>
          In case you submit an extended version of a paper already published (e.g. in a conference), we would expect at
          least 30%
          of the new submission to be novel. This novelty requirement can be satisfied by, for example, including
          missing proofs,
          details and experiments that were missing in the original publication.
