## Science Popularization

I love science promotion, and I think that sharing science with everyone is an essential part of our work. 
I participated to (and surprisingly won) a few (French) contests of science promotion: [MT180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdVQyov38sQ), which is the French edition of 3 minute thesis, and [5 minutes to convince](/assets/pdf/5_minutes_pour_convaincre.pdf). 

I also play an active role in the organization of events for the general public, such as open days or science festivals. In particular, I am involved in promoting research among students, especially [girls](https://filles-et-maths.fr/). I illustrate logic through games and puzzle-solving, using examples such as the riddles of the [Princess and the tiger](/assets/pdf/tiger.pdf) or the [Dreadbury Mansion](/assets/pdf/agatha.pdf).


## Artifact Evaluation Track Template

If you want to organize an Artifact Evaluation track for you workshop or conference and need some templates (author guide, reviewer guide, ...), feel free to reuse [this work](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AqZA5qwYZGBPhOO9AtJIJvYzne-tAYb?usp=sharing).


## Where Did We Meet?

I went to various places, and met a lot of people, that I am unfortunately not always able to remember. So, if you think we already met somewhere, you can verify your intuition here!

## How Can I Initiate a Conversation with You?
We are attending the same event right now, but you don't know how to talk to me? You have come to the right place!  
First of all, if I am at a conference, it often means that I have accepted that I am going to be talking to people during this time, so any chat is welcome.  
However, if you are really intimidated by me (I know, I am scary) or struggling about how to talk, here's a list of phrases to get the conversation started (you just need to adapt them to the corresponding situation):
  * "Hi! I attended your talk, it was nice/terrible. In particular, you said something about X, can you tell me more about that?"
  * "You talk about TOPIC, and I read/wrote/know something about that, do you know REFERENCE?"
  * "Oh, you are from PLACE. I know SOMEONE/have been THERE sometimes, do you know this PERSON/PLACE?"
  * "The last talk was great! Did you know anything about TOPIC before?"
  * "Hi, do you plan to give a talk/have you already given a talk during the event?"
  * "Your talk/beamer theme was great! How can you make so beautiful things in LaTeX?"
  * "Hey! We met at PREVIOUS_EVENT, how have you been since then?"
  * "Oh, you are associate professor! What do you teach?"
  * "Hello, nice glasses/hat/hair/shirt/name tag/keyring/RANDOM THING I HAVE WITH ME!"
  * "You attended the social event, right? I especially enjoyed the monkey trainer/shark rider/fire eater/food, wasn't that nice? "
  * "Here is some food."
  * "Germany is great, isn't it?"
  * "<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/squirrel_dealer.png">Do you like squirrels?</a>"

Note that this list is bound to grow, so don't be afraid to try something different, and it may end up on it one day!
